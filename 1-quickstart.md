Once your account is created, you're ready to send yourself an email created from your online account or from your personal email account.  

## Add email addresses

If you would like to include more recipients, there are a few ways to do this.  If you have a handful addresses, you can add them one at a time.  Or, if you have a spreadsheet of addresses, you can upload the file.  Or, you can copy and paste addresses as another upload option.

## Send a email

When ready, send an email either from your online account or your personal email account.

Easy peasy.  And now you can check your [Email Feed](/4-feed/1-feedIntro.md) for your new email.
