Once your account is created, you're ready to send yourself an email created from your online account or from your personal email account.  

## Add email addresses

If you would like to include more recipients, there are a few ways to do this.  For a handful addresses, you can either [add them one at a time](/2-members/1_3-membersAdd.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-13membersAdd) or [copy and paste a list of addresses](/2-members/1_1-membersAdd.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-11membersAdd) to add them all at once.  Or, if you have a spreadsheet of addresses, you can [upload the file](/2-members/1_2-membersAdd.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-12membersAdd) to your membership.

## Send a email

When ready, send a quick email from your personal inbox using your account's group email address, which Administrators can look up by signing into your account, clicking the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> and emailing "To" the **Address** under **Core account settings**.

Easy peasy.  And now you can check your [Email Feed](/4-feed/1-feedIntro.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-4feeed-1feedInto) for your new email.

Here's more details for sending from your [online account](/3-send/1-sendOnline.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-1sendOnline) or your [personal inbox](/3-send/2-sendInbox.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-2sendInbox).
