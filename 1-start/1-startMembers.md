# Getting Started

## Add new Members/Subscribers
<span id="gv-add-new-members"></span>

New members can be added to your account or sub-group in the following
ways:

* Upload an import file
* Add new members from the **Membership** page
* Have Subscribers sign up

### Upload an import file
<span id="gv-upload-an-import-file"></span>

For information on importing a membership file,

<span class="todo">
**click here JHJHJHlink-needed**.
</span>

### Add new members from the Membership page
<span id="gv-add-new-members-from-the-membership"></span>

To add a new member to your account, you can enter their information on
the **Add New Member** tab on your **Membership** page, and then click
**Add JHJHJHlink-needed**.

<span class=”g4s”>

When a new member is added this way, they are ready **JHJHJH s/b already?**
opted-in and ready to receive email.

If Welcome emails are sent (set on the Gear’s **JHJHJHGear?** **Account
Settings** tab), new members are sent an email with links to the
**Email Feed** and to their profile page where they can set attributes
and join available lists and sub-groups.
We recommend sending "Welcome" emails to give new members access to
their profile page.

<span class="free sub">

When a new member is added this way, they are sent an email
where **JHJHJHgrammar?** they need to click a button to accept the
invitation to join and which contains links to the Email Feed and to
their profile page where they can set attributes and join available
lists and sub-groups.
Once they accept, they are opted-in and ready to receive email.

</span>

### Have Subscribers sign up
<span id="gv-have-subscribers-sign-up"></span>

All accounts are equipped with a public page where people can sign up to
subscribe to your emails.
You can find your sign up page’s URL on the **Add New Member** tab on
your **Membership** page.
Also, at the bottom of the **Add New Member** tab, we’ve provided HTML
code that you can add to your own website so people can sign up from
there.

Your sign up page will be customized with your account theme that
includes shades of its primary color and logo.
You can also replace the default text on your sign-up page by editing
the **Subscription Sign-up** page on the **Gear’s JHJHJHGear? Site
Customizations** tab.

Once a subscriber signs up, they are emailed to confirm their interest
in subscribing and to verify their email address.
Then depending on your **Membership settings** on the **Gear’s
JHJHJHGear? Account Settings** tab:

<span class=”sub g4s”>

* If an Administrator approval is required to admit a new subscriber to
your account, then the subscriber’s application will appear on the
**Pending Applications** tab on the **Membership** page.
* If the Administrator approves, then the new subscriber will be
opted-in to receive email.
If Administrator approval is not required, then once the new subscriber
confirms their interest, they will be opted-in to receive email. 

* Administrators can opt to receive an email notifying them of a new
applicant.
We suggest setting this to `No` and checking the **Pending
Applications** tab often until you notice new applications slowing,
and then turning this setting on.

* If "Welcome" emails are sent, new subscribers are sent an email with
links to the group’s **Email Feed JHJHJHlink?** and their
profile **JHJHJHlinklink-needed?** where they can set attributes and join
available lists and sub-groups.

If "Welcome" emails are sent, new subscribers are sent an email with
inks to the group’s **Email Feed** and their profile page where they can
set attributes and join available lists and sub-groups.
