### Add new members from the Membership page

To add a new member to your account, you can enter their information on
the **Add New Member** tab on your **Membership** page, and then click
**Add**.

When a new member is added this way, they are already opted-in and
ready to receive email.

If Welcome emails are sent (as set in the **Account Settings**
tab on the
<img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Configurat** page),
new members are sent an email with links to the **Email Feed** and to
their profile page where they can set attributes and join available
lists and sub-groups.  We recommend sending "Welcome" emails to give
new members access to their profile page.

need to click a button to accept the invitation to join and which
contains links to the Email Feed and to their profile page where they

 accept, they are opted-in and ready to receive email.

### Have Subscribers sign up

All accounts are equipped with a public page where people can sign up to
subscribe to your emails.
You can find your sign up page's URL on the **Add New Member** tab on
your **Membership** page.
Also, at the bottom of the **Add New Member** tab, we've provided HTML
code that you can add to your own website so people can sign up from
there.

Your sign up page will be customized with your
[**account theme**](/3-send/4-sendSettings.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-4sendsettings-theme-colors)
that includes shades of its primary color and logo.
You can also replace the default text on your sign-up page by editing
the **Subscription Sign-up** page on the
Account Settings <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22">
**Site Customizations** tab.


Once a subscriber signs up, they are emailed to confirm their interest
in subscribing and to verify their email address.
Then depending on your **Membership settings** on the
**Account Settings**

<span class="sub g4s">

* If an Administrator approval is required to admit a new subscriber to
your account, then the subscriber's application will appear on the
**Pending Applications** tab on the **Membership** page.
If the Administrator approves, then the new subscriber will be
opted-in to receive email.
If Administrator approval is not required, then once the new subscriber
confirms their interest, they will be opted-in to receive email. 

* Administrators can opt to receive an email notifying them of a new
applicant.
We suggest setting this to **"No"** and checking the **Pending
Applications** tab often until you notice new applications slowing,
and then turning this setting on.

* If "Welcome" emails are sent, new subscribers are sent an email with
links to the group's **Email Feed** and their profile page where they
can set attributes and join available lists and sub-groups.
