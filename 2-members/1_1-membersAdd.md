## Pasting a List of Member Addresses

An option to uploading a file to add new members is to copy addresses, e.g. from an email in your inbox, and paste them into the `Paste email addresses here` box on the **Membership**'s **Upload & Export** page, and click `Upload Addresses`.

New members will be opted-in and ready to receive email.

If Welcome emails are sent (as set on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Account Settings** page),
new members will receive an email with links to your Email Feed and to
their Profile, where they can set attributes and join available
lists and sub-groups.  We recommend sending Welcome emails to give
new members access to their Profile.
