New members will be opted-in and ready to receive email.

If Welcome emails are sent (as set on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Account Settings** page),
new members will receive an email with links to your Email Feed and their Profile, where they can set attributes and join available
lists and sub-groups.  We recommend sending Welcome emails to give
new members access to their Profile.
