# Managing your Membership

<span id="gv-2members-14membersAdd"></span>
## Have Subscribers Sign Up

All accounts are equipped with a public page where people can sign up to
subscribe to your emails.
You can find this URL, e.g. https://*myaccount*.trivy.email/subscribe, on the **Membership**'s **Add New Member** page. 

<span class="adv">
  
At the bottom of the Add New Member page, we've provided HTML
code that you can add to your own website so people can sign up from
there.

</span> <!-- adv -->

Your sign up page will be customized with your
[account theme](/3-send/4-sendSettings.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-4sendsettings-theme-colors),
which includes your account logo and shades of its primary color.
You can also replace the default text on your sign up page by editing
the **Subscription Sign-up Page** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Site Customizations** page.

Once a subscriber signs up, they are emailed to confirm their interest
and to verify their email address.
Then depending on the **Membership** settings on your 
<img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Account Settings** page:

<span class="sub g4s">

* If **Administrator approval is required for new subscribers?** is set to `Yes`, then the subscriber's application will appear on your 
**Membership**'s **Pending Applications** page.
If an Administrator approves, the new subscriber will then be opted-in to receive email.
If an Administrator approval is not required, then once the new subscriber
confirms their interest, they will be opted-in to receive email. 

* If **New applicants generate email notifications?** is set to `Yes`, then Administrators will receive an email notifying them of a new pending applicant.
To minimize notifications, we suggest initially setting this to `No` and checking the Pending
Applications page often.  When new applications slow down, then set this to `Yes` so new applications are not missed.

* If **Always send welcome emails?** is set to `Yes`, then new subscribers will be emailed links to your Email Feed and their Profile, where they
can set attributes and join available lists and sub-groups.
