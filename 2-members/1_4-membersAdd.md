## Have Subsribers Sign Up

All accounts are equipped with a public page where people can sign up to
subscribe to your emails.
You can find the URL for this page on the Membership's Add New Member page.

<span class="adv">
  
Also, at the bottom of the Add New Member page, we've provided HTML
code that you can add to your own website so people can sign up from
there.

</span> <!-- adv -->

Your sign up page will be customized with your
[account theme](/3-send/4-sendSettings.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-4sendsettings-theme-colors),
which includes your account logo and shades of its primary color.
You can also replace the default text on your sign-up page by editing
the Subscription Sign-up Page on the

Site Customizations page.


Once a subscriber signs up, they are emailed to confirm their interest
and to verify their email address.
Then depending on your Membership settings on the

page:

* If an Administrator approval is required to admit a new subscriber, then the subscriber's application will appear on your 
Membership's Pending Applications page.
If an Administrator approves, the new subscriber will then be
opted-in to receive email.
If an Administrator approval is not required, then once the new subscriber
confirms their interest, they will be opted-in to receive email. 

* Administrators can opt to receive an email notifying them when a new pending applicant.
To minimize notifications, we suggest initially turning this off and checking the Pending
Applications page often.  When new applications slow down, then turn this setting on.

* If Welcome emails are sent, new subscribers are emailed links to your Email Feed and their profile page where they
can set attributes and join available lists and sub-groups.
