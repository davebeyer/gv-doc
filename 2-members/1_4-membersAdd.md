# Managing your Membership

<span id="gv-2members-14membersAdd"></span>
## Have Subscribers Sign Up

All accounts are equipped with a public page where people can sign up to
subscribe to your emails.
You can find this URL, e.g. https://*myaccount*.groupvine.com/subscribe, on the **Membership**'s **Add New Member** page. 

<span class="adv">
  
At the bottom of the Add New Member page, we've provided HTML
code that you can add to your own website so people can sign up from
there.

</span> <!-- adv -->

Your sign up page will be customized with your
[account theme](/3-send/4-sendSettings.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-4sendsettings-theme-colors),
which includes your account logo and shades of its primary color.

<span class="sub g4s">
  
You can also replace the default text on your sign up page by editing
the **Subscription Sign-up Page** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Site Customizations** page.

<span class="highlight">

For the application process, first set up the [Profile](/2-members/5-membersProfile.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-5membersprofile) by 
clicking **Member Profile Page** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22">**Site Customizations** page.  Setting up the Profile allows you to customize what attributes members can set themselves, and which lists and sub-groups they can self-join.  

Once a subscriber signs up, they are emailed to confirm their interest
and to verify their email address along with a link to your Email Feed and to their Profile, 
where they can set themselves up.

If you would like members to update their Profile, you can send an email from your online account and from the **Pers...** (short for Personalization) menu, 
add *Link to Profile* to your email, which shows up as a "Profile" link.

Then depending on the **Membership** settings on your

<span class="sub g4s">

* If **Administrator approval is required for new subscribers?** is set to `Yes`, then the subscriber's application will appear on your 
**Membership**'s **Pending Applications** page.
If an Administrator approves, the new subscriber will then be opted-in to receive email.
If an Administrator approval is not required, then once the new subscriber
confirms their interest, they will be opted-in to receive email. 

* If **New applicants generate email notifications?** is set to `Yes`, then Administrators will receive an email notifying them of a new pending applicant.
To minimize notifications, we suggest initially setting this to `No` and checking the Pending
Applications page often.  When new applications slow down, then set this to `Yes` so new applications are not missed.

* If **Always send welcome emails?** is set to `Yes`, then new subscribers will be emailed links to your Email Feed and their Profile, where they
can set attributes and join available lists and sub-groups.
