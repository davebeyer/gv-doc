## Member Lists

Lists give you the flexibility to target an email to a subset of your
membership, to which you often send email.  Key list features include:

* Lists have their own group email address which can be used to email
 from a personal email account.  For information on emailing from your personal email account, click [here](/3-send/2-sendInbox.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-2sendInbox) or click [here](/3-send/1-sendOnline.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-1sendOnline) for information on emailing from your online account.

* New lists can be created and members can be added to those lists using an upload file.  Click [here](/2-members/1_2-membersAdd.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-12membersAdd-uploading-to-member-lists) for more details.

* Sub-group senders can email to a list that was defined in a parent group to reach their members on that list.

To allow subscribers to join lists from their Profile, select the
lists from the Member Profile Page on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Site Customizations** page.  For more Profile information, click [here](/2-members/5-membersProfile.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-5membersprofile).
