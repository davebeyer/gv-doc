## Use lists to target an interest group

Lists give you the flexibility to target an email to a subset of your
membership that you often email.  

Key list features include:

* Lists have their own group email address which can be used to email the list 
 from a personal email account.  For information on emailing from your personal inbox, click [here](/3-send/2-sendInbox.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-2sendInbox). For information on emailing from your online account, click [here](/3-send/1-sendOnline.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-1sendOnline).

* Lists can be added on the **Membership**'s **Manage Lists** page or created using an upload file.  Click [here](/2-members/1_2-membersAdd.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-12membersAdd-uploading-to-member-lists) for more details.

By default, members are not able to join a new list from their Profile.  You can configure the **Member Profile Page** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Site Customizations** page to select which lists members will have access to join on their Profile.  For more Profile information, click [here](/2-members/5-membersProfile.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-5membersprofile).
