# Managing your Membership

## Use lists to target an interest group
<div id="gv-use-lists-to-target"></div>

Lists give you the flexibility to target an email to a sub-set of your
membership.
Key features of lists include the following:

* Lists have their own group email address which can be used to send
email from a personal email account.

* New lists can be created and members can be assigned to those lists
when importing.  Click here **JHJHJHlink-needed** for details.

* Sub-groups can view which of their members are on a list that was
defined in a parent group, and email their members who are on that list.

To allow subscribers to join lists from their profile page, select the
lists to be visible to the subscriber from the account Gear’s **Site
Customizations** tab.
Note, from their profile page, subscribers can only join lists defined
in the account level.
Group Administrators will need to add sub-group members to their local
lists.
Click ** here JHJHJHlink-needed** for more information on profile pages.

Normally, the group’s Administrators and Editors send email to member
lists and list recipients can only reply to the sender.
**class="sub g4s" Not sure how to apply "class=sub g4s"" to this
next sentence without detaching it from the previous sentence. Using a
div forces a new paragraph**
<span class="sub g4s">If you are interested in allowing general members
to send email, then we suggest using sub-groups.</span>

Click **here JHJHJHlink-needed** for details on sending to a list from
your online account or from your personal email account.
