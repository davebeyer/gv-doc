### Sub-groups

Sub-groups provide additional flexibility in how you manage your
membership and target your emails.
Here are a sub-group’s key features:

* Sub-groups have their own membership that is selected from members of
the parent group and independent from other sub-groups.

* Sub-groups have their own group email address which can be used to
send email from a personal email account.

* Sub-groups have their own Email Feed that can be visible to the
public, sub-group members only, or account members only.

* Sub-groups have their own color theme and logo.

* Sub-groups can create their own lists and can send to a list defined
in a parent group which will send an email to their sub-group members
on that parent list.

* Sub-groups have their own group administrator(s) and editor(s) with
capabilities local to their group. 

* Sub-groups can allow its general members to send email using the
group email address.
**Can general members also send group emails?** can be set on the
Gear’s **Sub-group Settings** tab.

* Sub-groups can be moderated where the group administrators are
emailed emails sent from a personal email account to review and either
approve or deny the email’s release.
**Is group moderated?** can be set on the Gear’s **Sub-group Settings**
tab.

To allow subscribers to join sub-groups from their profile page, select
the sub-groups to be visible to the subscriber from the account Gear’s
**Site Customizations** tab.
