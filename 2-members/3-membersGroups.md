# Managing your Membership

## Use Sub-groups for groups that can work independently from the main group

<span class="sub g4s">

Sub-groups provide additional flexibility in how you manage your
membership and target your emails.  New sub-groups can be added
on the Membership's "Manage Sub-groups" page. 

Here are a sub-group's key features:

* Sub-groups have their own membership that is selected from the parent group's membership and is independent from other sub-groups.

* Sub-groups have their own group email address which can be used to
send email from a personal inbox.  For information on emailing from your personal inbox, click [here](/3-send/2-sendInbox.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-2sendInbox) or click [here](/3-send/1-sendOnline.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-1sendOnline) for information on emailing from your online account.

* Sub-groups have their own [Email Feed](/4-feed/1-feedIntro.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-4feed-1feedIntro) that can be visible to the
public, sub-group members only, or account members only.  Individual emails can also have their visibility set in their feed.

* Sub-groups can have their own color theme and logo.  If it is not set, then the sub-group's color theme and logo will default to the account's settings.

* Sub-groups can create their own lists.  Sub-group senders can email to their sub-group lists or to a list that was defined in a parent group to reach their members who are on that list.

* Sub-groups have their own group administrator(s) and editor(s) whose 
capabilities are local to their group. 

* Sub-groups can allow its general members to send email to the sub-group by setting **Can general members also send group emails** on its 
<img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Sub-group Settings** page.  General members would use the sub-group's group email address and email using their personal inbox.

* Sub-groups can be moderated by setting **Is group moderated?** on 
its <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Sub-group Settings**  page.  Group administrators are sent emails to review and they can approve or deny the email's release.

To allow members to join sub-groups from their [Profile](/2-members/5-membersProfile.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-5membersprofile), select the
sub-groups to be available from the **Member Profile Page** on the account's <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Site Customizations** page. 

To email your sub-group, click [here](/3-send/2-sendInbox.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-2sendInbox) to send an email from your personal inbox or click [here](/3-send/1-sendOnline.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-1sendOnline) to email from your online account.
