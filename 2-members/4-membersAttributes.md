## Member Attributes

## Custom Member Attributes

Use Custom Attributes to save member information that is specific to your account needs and to customize your emails.  Custom Atributes are created on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Member Attributes** page, where you have a choice of four types of attributes:  Text, Number, Checkbox, and Single/Multiple Choice.

<span class="sub g4s">

Members are able to set their own attribute values from their [Profile](/2-members/5-membersProfile.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-5membersprofile).  Administrators decide which custom attributes are available to members on their Profile by selecting them from the **Member Profile Page** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Site Customizations** page.  Attribute values can also be set by uploading a file to your membership or by clicking a
member's ellipsis (<img src="/docimages/ellipsis.png" height="22">)
on the **Membership**'s **Member Listing** page.  For more information about uploading attributes,
click [here](/2-members/1_2-membersAdd.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-12membersAdd-uploading-member-attributes).

Attributes provide these email options to personalize and target your emails:

* Personalize your emails by inserting an attribute placeholder that will be translated to the recipient's attribute value in their delivered email.  For emails created in your online account, select the attribute from the "Persâ€¦" menu (short
for Personalization) in the email editor.
If you are sending from your personal email account, follow the
instructions on the **Personalize** tab after selecting to email from your own inbox on the **New Email** page.

* Use the Choice and Checkbox attributes as another way to target recipients.
For example, email recipients who selected the Checkbox attribute "Can you help with planning?" or who selected "Mornings" for a Choice attribute with  choices "Mornings", "Afternoons", and "Evenings."  For information about sending email, click [here](/3-send/2-sendInbox.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-2sendInbox) to send from your personal inbox or click [here](/3-send/1-sendOnline.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-1sendOnline) to send from your online account.

Note

* Modifying the definition of a custom attribute is not allowed since members may have already set its value.  To "change" an attribute, we recommend first exporting your membership to save its current state.  Then add a new, corrected attribute and if necessary, edit the **Member Profile Page** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Site Customizations** page to replace the incorrect attribute with the new, updated attribute on the member's Profile.

## Pre-defined Member Attributes

There are a handful of pre-defined attributes on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Member Attributes** page.  These attributes can be used in your emails just like custom attributes described above and are always available on the member's Profile.
