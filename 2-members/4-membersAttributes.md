## Member Attributes

## Custom Member Attributes

Use Custom Attributes to save member information that is specific to your account needs and to customize your emails.  Custom Atributes are created on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Member Attributes** page, where you have a choice of four types of attributes:  Text, Number, Checkbox, and Single/Multiple Choice.

Attributes provide you with these email options:

* Personalize your emails by inserting a placeholder for the recipient's attribute value.
For emails created in your online account, select the attribute to include in your email from the "Persâ€¦" menu (short
for Personalization) in the email editor.
If you are sending from your personal email account, then follow the
instructions on the **Personalize** tab after selecting to email from your own inbox on the **New Email** page.

* Target recipients using the Choice and Checkbox attributes.
For example, email recipients who selected the Checkbox attribute "Can you help with planning?" or who selected "Mornings" for a Choice attribute with  choices "Mornings", "Afternoons", and "Evenings."  For information about sending email, click [here](/3-send/2-sendInbox.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-2sendInbox) to send from your personal inbox or click [here](/3-send/1-sendOnline.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-1sendOnline) to send from your online account.

<span class="sub g4s">

Allow members to set attribute values from their [Profile](/2-members/5-membersProfile.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-5membersprofile) by selecting which custom attributes are available from the **Member Profile Page** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Site Customizations** page. 

</span> <!-- sub g4s -->

Attribute values can also be set by uploading a file to your membership or by clicking on a
member's ellipsis (<img src="/docimages/ellipsis.png" height="22">)
on the Membership's Member Listing page.  For more information about uploading attributes,
click [here](/2-members/1_2-membersAdd.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-12membersAdd-uploading-member-attributes).

Note

* Modifying the definition of a custom attribute is not allowed since members may have already set its value.  To "change" an attribute, we recommend first exporting your membership to save its current state.  Then add a new, corrected attribute and if necessary, edit your <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Site Customizations** page to replace the incorrect attribute with the new, updated attribute on the member's Profile.

## Pre-defined Member Attributes

There are a handful of pre-defined attributes on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Member Attributes** page.  These attributes can be used in your emails just like custom attributes described above and are always available on the member's Profile.
