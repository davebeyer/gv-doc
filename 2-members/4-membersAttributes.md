## Member Attributes

<span class="todo">
## We use a header line further below, don't we need one here? JHJHJH
</span>

Use Member Attributes to save subscriber information that is specific to
your account needs.
You can define attributes on your account Gear’s
**Member Attributes** tab and here are the four types of attribues:
**Text**, **Number**, **Checkbox**, and **Single/Multiple Choice**.

Attributes also provide these additional email options:

* Personalize your emails by inserting a placeholder for the recipient’s
attribute value.
If you are sending from your online account, use the **Pers…** (short
for "Personalization") menu in the email editor.
If you are sending from your personal email account, then follow the
instructions on the **Personalize** tab when you select **Send email**
from your own inbox on the **New Email** page.

* Target recipients using the Choice and Checkbox attributes.
For example, you can choose your recipients to be subscribers who
selected the checkbox attribute for `Can you help with planning for
XYZ?`

for more information about sending email using attributes.
From their profile page, subscribers can set attribute values that
are made available to them by the Administrator on the account Gear’s
**Site Customizations** tab.  

Attribute values can be set using an import file or by clicking on a
subscriber's ellipsis **(3 vertical dots)**
<span class="todo">
**JHJHJH icon-needed?**
</span>
from the **Member Listing** tab on the **Membership** page.

.

Note, editing an attribute’s definition is not allowed since
subscribers may have set values to that attribute.
Before making changes or deletions, we recommend first exporting your
membership to save its current state.
Then, add a new attribute and edit your **Site Customizations** to
replace the incorrect attribute with the new, updated attribute to the
subscriber profile page.

## Pre-defined Member Attributes
There are a handful of predefined attributes that can be found on the
Gear’s **Member Attributes** tab.
These attributes can be used in your emails just like the custom
attributes described above and are always available on the profile page.
