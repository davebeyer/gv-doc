## What's on the Member's Profile

A member's Profile is where all the information about the member is kept and consists of the following:

<span class="sub g4s"> 

* Pre-defined attributes 
* Custom attributes 
* List membership 
* Sub-group membership
* Opt-out status
* Role (only visible to the Administrator)
* Password (only applies to Administrators and Editors)

</span> <!-- sub g4s -->

<span class="free"> 

* Pre-defined attributes 
* Custom attributes 
* List membership 
* Opt-out status
* Role (only visible to the Administrator)
* Password (only applies to Administrator)

</span> <!-- free -->

<span class="sub g4s"> 
 
By default, pre-defined attributes are always visible on the member's
Profile.  However, which custom attributes, lists, and sub-groups are available to the member
to set or join is determined by the Account Administrator from the **Member Profile Page** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22">
**Site Customizations** page.  (Pre-defined attributes are listed at the bottom of the
<img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Member Attributes** page.)

Administrators can also update member profiles by uploading a file or by selecting the
member's ellipsis (<img src="/docimages/ellipsis.png" height="22">) on the **Membership**'s **Member Listing** page.  For more information on uploading, click [here](/2-members/1_2-membersAdd.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-12membersAdd).
