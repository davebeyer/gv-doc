## What's on the Member's Profile

A member's Profile is where all the information about the member is kept and consists of the following:

* Pre-defined attributes 
* Custom attributes 
* List membership 
* Sub-group membership
* Opt-out status
* Role (only visible to the Administrator)
* Password (only applies to Administrators and Editors)

By default, pre-defined attributes are always visible on the member's
Profile.  However, the custom attributes, lists, and sub-groups available to the member
to set or join is determined by the Account Administrator on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22">
Site Customization page.  (Pre-defined attributes are listed at the bottom of the
<img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Member Attributes page.)

Administrators can also update member profiles by uploading a file or selecting the
member's ellipsis (<img src="/docimages/ellipsis.png" height="22">) on the Membership's Member Listing page.  For more information on uploading, click [here](/2-members/1_2-membersAdd.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-12membersAdd).

Note

* Only the member can change their Opt-out status

* Only Administrators or Editors can change their password

General members are able to access their Profile by:

* Clicking the "View live email" link at the top of any community
email and then clicking **My Profile**.
 
* Submitting their information on the account's subscription page and then 
clicking their profile link in the email sent to confirm their interest.
