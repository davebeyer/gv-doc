# Managing your Membership

<span class="todo">
What's on the Member's Profile Page OR Subscriber Profile Page, JHJHJH
which should be used?  DB: John, not sure of the precise question, but fyi,
"members" and "member subscribers" (and sometimes "subscribers") can
be used interchangeably depending on context.

## What's on the Member's Profile Page

The profile page is a way for subscribers to set and join the following
on their own, which frees up the administrator from having to manage all
of their members' settings:

* Predefined attributes 
* Custom attributes 
* Account member lists 
* Sub-groups

By default, predefined attributes are always visible on the subscriber's
profile page.
Other custom attributes, lists, and sub-groups can also be part of the
profile page, and Administrators can choose which are visible for
subscribers to set or join themselves from the

**Site Customization** tab.  (Predefined attributes are listed at the bottom
of the

**Member Attributes** tab.)

Administrators can update subscriber profiles too by selecting the
subscriber's ellipsis

on the **Member Listing** tab on the **Membership** page.
However, only the subscriber can change their Opt-out status or password
(if they are an Administrator or Editor) from their profile page.

General members can access their profile page by either:

* Clicking the "View live email" link at the top of any community
email and then clicking **My Profile**.
 
* Entering their information on the account's subscription page and
clicking the profile link in the email to confirm their interest.
