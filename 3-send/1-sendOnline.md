# Send email from your online account

To compose and send an email from your online account, select New
dEmail in the header and then select **Prepare email online**.

By default the **New** tab is selected to create a new email from
scratch (Note, for your very first email, you'll start by entering the
email's subject).  You may also have a **Drafts**, **Templates**,
and **Published** tabs.  

* A Draft email is "under construction" and may have been emailed as a
draft to the Administrators and Editors in the group, but has yet to be
sent/published to its intended recipients.  

* A Template is an email whose contents are a starting point for
periodic emails, e.g. weekly newsletters.  The templates on this tab
have been saved either in the current group or in a parent group.  

* Published emails have been sent and published to the group, and show
up in the group's Feed.
From your online account, published emails can be
resent by either copying it to a new email or resending "as is".
A new copied email can be edited and its Email Widget responses will be
independent and separate from the original email.
Resending "as is" does not allow any changes, but the resent email
keeps Email Widget responses of the original email and any "as is"
resends collectively together, which may be needed if you're emailing
additional or forgotten recipients.

Once you've selected your starting point, here are some unique
features to consider adding to personalize and customize your emails:

* Personalize your email with attributes.
If you are sending from your online account, use the Pers… (short for
"Personalization") menu in the email editor.
To your email is added a placeholder which will be translated to the
subscriber's value in their received email.

<span class="todo">
JH: Maybe "First Name" should be an img or icon?
</span> <!-- todo -->

For example, in your email if you type "Hi " and then select “First
Name” from the Personalization menu, the placeholder "First Name"
is added to your
email.  When you Preview your email, you'll see the attribute placeholder
was replaced with your First Name as you have it set in your profile.

.

* Use Email Widgets to ask questions or gather information with these
five types of Email Widgets (Text, Count, RSVP, Yes-No,
Single/Multi-Choice) that can be added directly into your email using
the **Widget** menu.

**fix link**
</span>
.

Note, your email will be "From" your display name, which is your
First Name and Last Name attributes as they are set in your profile
page.

For online emails we suggest previewing your email and sending it as a
draft to make sure images, links and files are behaving as you expect.
Note that links in the Preview have been deactivated.

When you're ready,
click **Send** to select your recipients and send your email.
Without making any selections before sending, your email will be sent
as not urgent to the entire group.  You can also:

* Select the **Mark email as urgent** checkbox to
have a text notification sent to recipients who specifically chose to
be notified of urgent emails.

* Make selections on the **Addressing** tab to change the recipients
to list(s) or to specific Choice or Checkbox attribute values. 

* Use the **Select Individuals** tab to change the recipients to be specific
recipients selected from your membership.  

* Review your recipient addresses on the **Recipient Addresses** tab
which is a good way to eyeball that your recipient list is correct
before publishing your email.

After sending your email, you'll be redirected to your group's Email
Feed.  If your email isn't listed at the top, wait a few minutes and
refresh your feed.
