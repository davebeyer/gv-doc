# Sending Emails

## Send email from your online account

To compose and send an email from your online account, select **New
Email** and then select **Prepare email online**.

By default the **New** tab is selected to create a new email from
scratch (Note, for your very first email, you'll start by entering the
email's subject).  You may also have a **Drafts**, **Templates**,
and **Published** tabs.  

* A Draft email is "under construction" and may have already been emailed as a
draft, but has yet to be sent/published to its intended recipients.  

* A Template is set up as a starting point for new emails that are sent often, e.g. weekly newsletters.  The templates on this tab
have been saved either in the current group or in a parent group.  

* Published emails have been sent to its recipients and are published to the group's Email Feed.

Once you've selected your starting point, consider including these unique
features to customize your email:

* Personalize your email by selecting an attribute from the **Pers…** menu (short for
Personalization) in the email editor.  Added to your email and representing the attribute, is a placeholder which will be translated to the recipient's value in their received email. 
For example, if you select “First Name” from the Personalization menu, the placeholder <img src="/docimages/FirstName_attribute.png" height="22">
is added to your email.  When previewing your email, the placeholder 
is replaced with your First Name as set in your Profile.

* Ask questions or gather information directly in your email by selecting one of the 
five types of Email Widgets (Text, Count, RSVP, Yes-No,
Single/Multi-Choice) from the **Widget** menu.  For more information about Email Widgets,
click [here](/5-widgets/1-ewIntro.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-5widgets-1ewIntro).

When you're ready, click **Send** to select your recipients and send/publish your email.  By default, your email will be sent to the entire group as non-urgent, otherwise:

* Select the **Mark email as urgent** checkbox to
have a text notification sent to recipients who chose to
be notified of urgent emails.

* Make selections on the **Addressing** tab to change the recipients
to list(s) or to specific Choice or Checkbox attribute values. 

* Use the **Select Individuals** tab to select specific recipients from your membership.

* Review your recipient addresses on the **Recipient Addresses** tab.  
This is a good way to eyeball that your recipient list is correct
before publishing your email.

After sending your email, you'll be redirected to your group's Email
Feed.  If your email isn't listed at the top, wait a minutes and
refresh your feed.

Note

* Your email will be "From" your display name, which is your
First Name and Last Name attributes as they are set in your Profile.

* Links in Preview are deactivated.
