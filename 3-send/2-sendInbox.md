# Send email from a personal email account

To send an email to your account from your own inbox, simply send it
to your account's abbreviation ```@groupvine.com```, for example:

```
bingotech@groupvine.com
```

<span class="highlight">

To avoid the risk of spammers sending emails to a group from a possibly
compromised email account, after an email is sent from a personal email,
a confirmation mail is sent to the sender where the sender must confirm
the email before it can be forwarded to the group.

</span>


To send to a specific sub-group, use the sub-group's Abbreviation with
the account's Abbreviation, for example:

```
team.bingotech@groupvine.com
```

The abbreviation to send to all addresses in your account or sub-group
can be found on the **Account Settings** or **Sub-group Settings**
tab on the respective **Gear** page.

Need the email address to target your emails more specifically?
Simply select **New Email** and then **Send email from your own
inbox**, select your options on the **Addressing** tab and
copy the updated email address to the "To" field in your email
account.

To personalize your email using attribute values, view the
instructions on the **Personalize** tab for emails sent from your
personal email account.

</span>
.

To add Email Widgets to ask questions or gather information, follow
the instructions on the **Widgets** tab for email sent from your
personal email account to add any of the four types of Email Widgets
(Text, Count, RSVP, and Yes-No).

<span class="todo">

</span>
.

Note, in general when sending from your personal email account,
your email will be "From" your display name, which is your
First Name and Last Name attributes as they are set in your profile
page, but your email handler may preset the "From" to the name
you have previously used to send email.

These emails will show up in the **Email Feed** with
<span class="todo">
inbox tray icon-needed
</span> <!-- todo -->
to identify that the email was sent from a personal email account.
