# Sending Emails

## Send email from a personal email account

<span class=highlight>
  
To avoid the risk of spammers sending emails to a group from a possibly compromised email account, after emailing from your inbox, a confirmation mail is emailed to the sender where the sender must confirm the email send before it can be forwarded to its recipients.

</span> <!-- highlight -->

To send an email to your account from your inbox, use your account's Address found on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Account Settings page, for example:

```
bingotech@groupvine.com
```

<span class="g4s sub"> 

Similarly, to send to a sub-group from your inbox, use the sub-group's Address found on the sub-group's corresponding 
<img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Sub-group Settings page, for example:

```
team.bingotech@groupvine.com
```

</span> <!-- g4s sub -->

If you need a more targeted email address or want to include customizations, simply select **New Email** and then select **Send email from 
your own inbox**.

* On the **Addressing** tab you can select to send a draft or urgent email, or send to a list or to recipients with specific attribute values set.  Make your selections and copy the updated email address to the "To" field of your new email in 
your personal email account.  

* Include pre-defined or your custom member attribute values by following the
instructions on the **Personalize** tab.  For more information about Member Attributes,
click [here](/2-members/4-membersattributes.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-4membersattributes).

* Ask questions or gather information directly in your email by adding Email Widgets.  Follow 
the instructions on the **Widgets** tab to add any of the four types of Widgets
(Text, Count, RSVP, and Yes-No).  The Email Widget's question is just normal text in your email.  For more information about Email Widgets,
click [here](/5-widgets/1-ewIntro.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]).

Once your email is sent, it will appear in your Email Feed with <img src="/docimages/sent-from-inbox-icon.png" height="22"> to 
identify that the email was sent from a personal email account.

Note

* The ability to drag-and-drop a member attribute images 
from the **Personalize** tab depends on the email service 
and/or email app you use.  Please create a test email to try out the drag-and-drop 
method with your system before sending an email. For example, dragging-and-dropping should 
work for gmail users composing emails online using the 
Google Chrome browser.

* In general, your email will be "From" your display name, which is your
First Name and Last Name attributes as they are set in your Profile, but your email handler may preset the "From" to 
the name you normally use to send email.
