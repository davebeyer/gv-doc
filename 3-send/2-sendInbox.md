## Send email from a personal email account

<span class=highlight>
  
To avoid the risk of spammers sending emails to a group from a possibly compromised email account, after emailing from your inbox, a confirmation mail is emailed to the sender where the sender must confirm the email send before it can be forwarded to its recipients.

</span> <!-- highlight -->

To send an email to your account from your inbox, use your account's **Address** found on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Account Settings** page, for example:

```
lighthouselabs@groupvine.com
```

<span class="g4s sub"> 

Similarly, to send to a sub-group from your inbox, use the sub-group's **Address** found on the sub-group's 
<img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Sub-group Settings** page, for example:

```
team.lighthouselabs@groupvine.com
```

</span> <!-- g4s sub -->

Once your email is sent, it will appear in your Email Feed with <img src="/docimages/sent-from-inbox-icon.png" height="22"> to 
identify that the email was sent from a personal email account.  If your email isn't listed at the top, wait a minute and click <img src="/docimages/refresh-feed-icon.png" width="22"> in the Email Feed header to 
refresh the feed.

In general, emails will be "From" the sender's display name, which is the
First Name and Last Name attributes in their Profile, but the sender's email handler may preset the "From" to 
the name normally used to send email.

## Find the email address to send to lists or recipients with specific attribute values

To find the email address to target lists or recipients with specific attribute values, select **New Email** and then select **Send email from 
your own inbox**.  On the **Addressing** tab select the lists and attributes you want your email to target and copy the updated email 
address to the "To" field of your email in your personal inbox.  If you use this email address often, you might want to add it to your contacts so the address is readily available to your when sending.

## Find the email address to send a draft or "urgent" email

To send a draft or ["urgent"](/3-send/3-sendTexts.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-3sendTexts) email, 
select **New Email** and then select **Send email from your own inbox**.  On the **Addressing** tab select *Send as a draft email* 
or *Mark email as urgent* and copy the updated email address to the "To" field of your new email in your personal email account.

## Include attributes and Email Widgets from your inbox!

To include customizations, simply select **New Email** and then select **Send email from 
your own inbox**.

* Include pre-defined or custom attribute values by following the
instructions on the **Personalize** tab.  For more information about Member Attributes,
click [here](/2-members/4-membersattributes.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-4membersattributes).

* Ask questions or gather information directly in your email by adding Email Widgets.  Follow 
the instructions on the **Widgets** tab to add any of the four types of Widgets
(Text, Count, RSVP, and Yes-No).  The Email Widget's question is just normal text in your email.  For more information about Email Widgets,
click [here](/5-widgets/1-ewIntro.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]).

Note

* The ability to drag-and-drop a member attribute images 
from the **Personalize** or **Widgets** tabs depend on the email service 
and/or email app you use.  Please create a test email to try out the drag-and-drop 
method with your system before sending an email. For example, dragging-and-dropping should 
work for gmail users composing emails online using the 
Google Chrome browser.
