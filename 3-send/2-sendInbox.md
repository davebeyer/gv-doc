## Send email from a personal email account

To send an email to your account from your inbox, use your account's Address that can be found on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Account Settings page, for example:

```
bingotech@groupvine.com
```

<span class="g4s sub"> 

Similarly, to send to a sub-group from your inbox, use the sub-group's Address that can be found on the sub-group's corresponding 
<img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Sub-group Settings page, for example:

```
team.bingotech@groupvine.com
```

</span> <!-- g4s sub -->

If you need a more targeted email address or want to include customizations, simply select **New Email** and then select **Send email from 
your own inbox**.

* Make your recipient selections on the **Addressing** tab and copy the updated email address to the "To" field of your new email in 
your personal email account.  By default, your email address will be send to all members in your group.

* Personalize your email using attribute values by following the
instructions on the **Personalize** tab.  For more information about Member Attributes,
click [here](/2-members/4-membersattributes.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-4membersattributes).

* Ask questions or gather information directly in your email by adding Email Widgets.  Follow 
the instructions on the **Widgets** tab to add any of the four types of Widgets
(Text, Count, RSVP, and Yes-No).  For more information about Email Widgets,
click [here](/5-widgets/1-ewIntro.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]).

```
To avoid the risk of spammers sending emails to a group from a possibly
compromised email account, after sending an email from your inbox, a
confirmation mail is emailed to the sender where the sender must confirm
the email send before it can be forwarded to its recipients.
```

Once your email is sent, it will appear in your Email Feed with <img src="/docimages/sent-from-inbox-icon.png" height="22"> to 
identify that the email was sent from a personal email account.

Note

* In general, when sending from your personal email account,
your email will be "From" your display name, which is your
First Name and Last Name attributes as they are set in your Profile, but your email handler may preset the "From" to the name
you normally use to send email.
