## Text notifications for new or "urgent" emails

Members can receive text notifications with a link to the
live email for either all or urgent only emails.  Members will still receive emails in their inbox and this just gives them
the option to be notified when one has arrived, which could be important
especially if it's urgent and needs their attention.

Accounts are already set up to send text notifications for members who
have provided all of the following mobile information on their Profile:

  * 10-digit mobile phone number, starting with the area code

  * Mobile phone carrier - Contact support@groupvine.com if your carrier is not listed

  * Text mode which can be No texts (default), Urgent emails, or All emails
  
Note

* Text messaging fees may apply based on each individual's mobile phone plan.
