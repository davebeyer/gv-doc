# Sending Emails

## Text notifications for new or "urgent" emails
<div id="gv-text-notifications"></div>

Members can optionally receive text notifications with a link to the
ive email for either all emails or just ones the sender has tagged as
**"Urgent"**.
(Text messaging fees may apply based on each individual's mobile phone
plan).

Members still receive emails in their inbox and this just gives them
the option to be notified when one has arrived, which could be important
especially if it's urgent and needs their attention.

Accounts are already set up to send text notifications for members who
have provided the following mobile information on their
**JHJHJHlink-needed** profile page.
**JHJHJHsuggestion Maybe some text indicating what the following bullets
are (e.g., The following items need to be specified for text
notifications ... :)**

  * Mobile phone number, including area code

  * Mobile phone carrier - please contact us at JHJHJHlink-needed
`support@groupvine.com` if your carrier isnâ€™t listed

  * Text mode - No text (default), text only for emails marked
**Urgent**, or text for all emails

<div class="box-text">
Note, all three pieces of information must be provided to receive text
notifications.
</div>
