# Sending Emails

## Text notifications for new or "urgent" emails
<span id="gv-text-notifications"></span>

Members can optionally receive text notifications with a link to the
ive email for either all emails or just ones the sender has tagged as
**"Urgent"**.
(Text messaging fees may apply based on each individual's mobile phone
plan).

Members still receive emails in their inbox and this just gives them
the option to be notified when one has arrived, which could be important
especially if it's urgent and needs their attention.

Accounts are already set up to send text notifications for members who
have provided the following mobile information on their
