# Sending Emails

## Text notifications for new or "urgent" emails

Members can receive text notifications containing a link to the
live email for either all emails or urgent only.
(Text messaging fees may apply based on each individual's mobile phone
plan).

Members still receive emails in their inbox and this just gives them
the option to be notified when one has arrived, which could be important
especially if it's urgent and needs their attention.

Accounts are already set up to send text notifications for members who
have provided the all of the following mobile information on their Profile:

  * 10-digit mobile phone number, including area code

  * Mobile phone carrier - Contact support@groupvine.com if your carrier is not listed

  * Text mode - No texts (default), Urgent emails, or All emails
