The email related settings below can be found on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Account Settings** and <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> 
**Sub-group Settings** pages.  These settings are identified with an `*` because if the sub-group's setting has not been set, it will default to the account's value, otherwise, the sub-group's settings will override its default value.

### Theme Colors & Logo
     
<span class="sub g4s">
     
Pick theme colors and upload a logo to your account and sub-groups to give each group their own look and feel.  The logo will appear on your Email Feed and shades of the theme's primary color will be used for the Email Feed, Subscribe page, and Email Widget summmary images.
Specifically for emails, if its layout uses a header, then the header
will use the primary color and group logo, and for emails composed online, Titles and Subsections
will use the theme's primary color and sections will use the theme's secondary color.

To set account colors, choose the Primary and Secondary colors for **Account theme** and upload an account logo by clicking `Select logo image` for **Account logo** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Account Settings** page.  Colors and logo are set similarly on a sub-group's <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Sub-group Settings** page.  Sub-group theme colors and logo will initially default to the account's settings unless they're overridden with their own settings.

### Default Email Layout

This is an account-wide setting that all emails sent from a personal inbox and that emails composed online will use,
unless the layout is overridden by an **Options** selection in the email's Compose header.  Select or change the **Default email layout** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Account Settings** page.

### Use Moderation to review emails before they are sent

Each group has their own moderation setting, which when turned on, adds an additional level of security to avoid the risk
of unwanted or inappropriate emails sent to a group.  When moderation is set to `Yes`, the Administrators of the group where the email originated will
first receive the pending email to review and can then either approve or deny its delivery.  

To turn moderation on or off, set **Is account moderated?** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Account Settings** page or set **Is group moderated?** on a sub-group's <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Sub-group Settings**
page.

### Who can send emails

<span class="free">

Only the Account Administrator can send email to members from their online account or personal inbox.

If additional senders are needed, you can upgrade to a Subscription service, which also offers other expanded services.
Go to your <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Subscription Status page and click 
to link to a comparison of our service offerings and upgrade options.

<span class="sub g4s">

By default, only Administrators and Editors can send email to their
group or to any lower level sub-group, and general members can only receive email.
If a general member attempts to send from their personal inbox
to a valid group email address, they will receive an error since they
are not authorized to send to that group.

However, Administrators can allow general members to send account emails from their 
personal inbox by setting **Can general members also send account emails?** 
on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Account Settings** page.  

Similarly, general members in a sub-group can be allowed to send sub-group emails by setting 
**Can general members also send group emails?** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Sub-group Settings** page.

If general members are allowed to send emails, we recommend turning on moderation so Administrators can review emails before they are sent.

<span class="todo">

Include the following??
     
Emails to new group subscribers/members, i.e. "Welcome" emails, "Accept
Invitation" emails, and "Confirm Interest" emails, where Administrators
do not need to approve of the new subscriber, include instructions on
how to send email to the group.
Only the "Confirm Interest" emails where an Administrator approval of
new subscribers does not include this information.  
     
To avoid the risk of spammers sending emails to a group from a possibly
compromised email account, after an email is sent from a personal
email account, a confirmation mail is sent to the sender where the sender must
confirm the email before it can be forwarded to the group.

### Email Feed visibility

</span> <!-- sub g4s -->

<span class="g4s">
     
By default, the account's Email Feed is private, where only account members can see the email listing and view emails.  Administrators can change this default by setting **Email feed visibility** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Account Settings** page.    

</span> <!-- g4s -->

<span class="sub ">

By default, the account's Email Feed is public, where Visitors can also see the email listing and view emails.  Administrators can change this default by setting **Email feed visibility** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Account Settings** page.   

</span> <!-- sub -->

<span class="sub g4s">

Sub-groups also have their own Email Feed visibility, which initially defaults to the parent's setting.  A sub-group's visibility can set to *Public*, 
*Account members only* or *Sub-group members only* by setting **Email feed visibility** on the sub-group's <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Sub-group 
Settings** page.  Limiting the feed's visibility to *Sub-group members only* will privatize the sub-group's emails to its sub-group members only.

From the Email Feed's Listing view (<img src="/docimages/listing-view-icon.png" height="22">) an individual email's default visibility can be changed by clicking the email's <img src="/docimages/public-private-eye-icon.png" height="22"> to toggle between public to private.

Note

* A public Email Feed allows Visitors to view emails that have not been specifically made private.  If a public email has Email Widgets, Visitors will be able to view the email and its Email Widget summary images, but not the individual responses.
