### Theme Colors & Logo
     
<span class="sub g4s">
     
Pick theme colors and upload a logo to your account and sub-groups to
give each group their own unique feel.
Shades of the theme's primary color will be used for the Email Feed and Subscribe page.
Sub-group theme colors and logo will initially default to the account's settings unless they're overridden with their own settings.

Also if your email layout has a header, then the header
will also use your primary color and group logo, and for emails created in your online account, Titles and Subsections
will use the theme's primary color and sections will use the theme's secondary color.

### Default Email Layout

Below are options for the account's default email layout that all emails will use unless the layout is overridden by making a selection
from **Options** in the email's Compose header.:

### Use Moderation to review emails before they are sent

Moderation adds an additional level of security to avoid the risk
of unwanted or inappropriate emails sent to a group.
When **Is account moderated?** is set to `Yes`, the Administrators
are first sent the pending email to review and can either approve or deny
its delivery.

### Who can send emails

<span class="free">

Only the Account Administrator can send email to members from their online account or personal inbox.

If additional senders are needed, you can upgrade to a Subscription service, which also offers other expanded services.
Go to your <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Subscription Status page and click 
to link to a comparison of our service offerings and upgrade options.

</span> <!-- free -->

<span class="sub g4s">

By default, only Administrators and Editors can send email to their
group or to any lower level sub-group from their online
account or personal inbox, and general members can only receive email.
If a general member attempts to send from their personal email account
to a valid group email address, they will receive an error since they
are not authorized to send to that group.

However, Administrators can allow general members to send
email from their personal email account to other members at the account level by setting **Can general members
also send account emails?** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Account Settings page or send 
to a other members of a specific sub-group by setting **Can general members
also send group emails?** on the sub-group's <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Sub-group Settings page.

</span> <!-- sub g4s -->

<span class="todo">

Include the following??
     
Emails to new group subscribers/members, i.e. "Welcome" emails, "Accept
Invitation" emails, and "Confirm Interest" emails, where Administrators
do not need to approve of the new subscriber, include instructions on
how to send email to the group.
Only the "Confirm Interest" emails where an Administrator approval of
new subscribers does not include this information.  
     
To avoid the risk of spammers sending emails to a group from a possibly
compromised email account, after an email is sent from a personal
email, a confirmation mail is sent to the sender where the sender must
confirm the email before it can be forwarded to the group.

### Email Feed visibility

<span class="g4s">
     
By default, the Email Feed is private, so only account members can see the email listing or view emails.    

</span> <!-- g4s -->

<span class="sub ">

By default, the Email Feed is public, so Visitors can see the email listing and view emails.  

</span> <!-- sub -->

Administrators can change this default by setting **Email feed visibility** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Account 
Settings page.  

Sub-groups also have their own visibility setting which initially defaults to the parent's visibility.  A sub-group's visibility can be changed to Public, 
Account members only or Sub-group members by setting **Email feed visibility** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Sub-group 
Settings page.  Limiting the feed's visibility to Sub-group members only will privatize the sub-group's emails to its sub-group members only.

Administrators can also change the visibility of individual emails from the Email Feed's Listing view (<img src="/docimages/listing-view-icon.png" height="22">), which take precedence over the Email Feed's default setting.

Note

* A public Email Feed will allow Visitors to view emails that have not been specifically privatized.  A public email with Email Widgets will allow Visitors to view the email and its Email Widget summary images only.
