### Theme Colors & Logo
     
<span class="sub g4s">
Theme colors and logo can be chosen for your account and sub-groups to
give each group their own unique feel.
Shades of the theme’s primary color are used for the group’s
**Email Feed** page and the account’s **Subscribe** page.  

Also if you are using an email template with a header, then the header
will use your primary color, and in the editor Titles and Subsections
will use the primary color and sections will use the secondary color.

If sub-group colors are not set, then their colors will default to the
account’s theme colors.

Each group can upload a logo which will appear on the group’s **Email
Feed**, **Subscription** page and in templates that include the logo.

### Default Email Layout

Here are the two options for the account’s **Default email layout**,
although the layout can be overridden by making a Layout selection
from **Options** in the email’s **Compose** header.

qualified by further class divs, and so they might not both be visible.

### Use Moderation to review emails before they are sent

Moderation adds an additional level of security to avoid the risk
of unwanted or inappropriate emails sent to a group.
When **Is account moderated?** is set to `Yes`, the Administrators
are sent the pending email to review and can either approve or deny
its delivery.

<span id="gv-2members-4sendsettings-who-can"></span>
### Who can send emails

<span class="free">

Only the Account Administrator can send emails to its
<span class="todo">
**JHJHJHeditorial group?**
</span>
members.
If you need additional senders, you can upgrade to a
Subscription service, which also offers other expanded services.

.

Note, Administrators and Editors are authorized senders in an account where
Administrators can also manage the account’s membership and settings.  

</span> <!-- free -->

<span class="sub g4s">

By default, only Administrators and Editors can send email to their
group or to any lower level sub-group within their group from their online
account or personal email account.  

By default, general members are set up to only receive email and reply
only to the sender.
If a general member attempts to send from their personal email account
to a valid group email address, they will receive an error since they
are not authorized to send to that group.
However, Administrators can allow general members in the group to send
email from their personal email account by setting **Can general members
also send account emails?** on the **Account Settings** tab or on each
**Sub-group Settings** tab on their respective **Gear** page.

</span> <!-- sub g4s -->

<span class="adv">
     
Emails to new group subscribers/members, i.e. "Welcome" emails, "Accept
Invitation" emails, and "Confirm Interest" emails, where Administrators
do not need to approve of the new subscriber, include instructions on
how to send email to the group.
Only the "Confirm Interest" emails where an Administrator approval of
new subscribers does not include this information.  

</span>

     
**To avoid the risk of spammers sending emails to a group from a possibly
compromised email account, after an email is sent from a personal
email, a confirmation mail is sent to the sender where the sender must
confirm the email before it can be forwarded to the group.**
