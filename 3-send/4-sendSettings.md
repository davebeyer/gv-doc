### Theme Colors & Logo
     
<span class="sub g4s">
     
Pick theme colors and upload a logo to your account and sub-groups to
give each group their own look and feel.
Shades of the theme's primary color will be used for the Email Feed and Subscribe page.
Sub-group theme colors and logo will initially default to the account's settings unless they're overridden with their own settings.

Also if your email layout has a header, then the header
will use your primary color and group logo, and for emails created in your online account, Titles and Subsections
will use the theme's primary color and sections will use the theme's secondary color.

To set account colors, choose the Primary and Secondary colors for Account theme and upload the account logo by clicking **Select logo image** for Account logo on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Account Settings page.  Colors and logo are set similarly on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Sub-group Settings page.

### Default Email Layout

By default, all emails sent from a personal email account will use the selected Default email layout, and emails created in your online account will 
also use this layout, unless the layout is overridden from an **Options** selection in the email's Compose header.  Select or change the Default email layout on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Account Settings page.

### Use Moderation to review emails before they are sent

Each group has their own moderation setting, which when turned on, adds an additional level of security to avoid the risk
of unwanted or inappropriate emails sent to a group. 

When moderation is set to `Yes`, Administrators will first receive the pending email to review and can then either approve or deny
its delivery.  

To set up moderation, or to turn it off for your account or a sub-group, set **Is account moderated?** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Account Settings 
page or set **Is group moderated?** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Sub-group Settings 
page.

### Who can send emails

<span class="free">

Only the Account Administrator can send email to members from their online account or personal inbox.

If additional senders are needed, you can upgrade to a Subscription service, which also offers other expanded services.
Go to your <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Subscription Status page and click 
to link to a comparison of our service offerings and upgrade options.

<span class="sub g4s">

By default, only Administrators and Editors can send email to their
group or to any lower level sub-group from their online
account or personal inbox, and general members can only receive email.
If a general member attempts to send from their personal inbox
to a valid group email address, they will receive an error since they
are not authorized to send to that group.

However, Administrators can allow general members to send account emails from their 
personal inbox by setting **Can general members also send account emails?** 
on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Account Settings page.  

Similarly, 
general members in a sub-group can be allowed to send sub-group emails by setting 
**Can general members also send group emails?** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Sub-group Settings page.

</span> <!-- sub g4s -->

<span class="todo">

Include the following??
     
Emails to new group subscribers/members, i.e. "Welcome" emails, "Accept
Invitation" emails, and "Confirm Interest" emails, where Administrators
do not need to approve of the new subscriber, include instructions on
how to send email to the group.
Only the "Confirm Interest" emails where an Administrator approval of
new subscribers does not include this information.  
     
To avoid the risk of spammers sending emails to a group from a possibly
compromised email account, after an email is sent from a personal
email account, a confirmation mail is sent to the sender where the sender must
confirm the email before it can be forwarded to the group.

### Email Feed visibility

</span> <!-- sub g4s -->

<span class="g4s">
     
By default, the Email Feed is set to private, where only account members will be able to see the email listing or view emails.  Administrators can change this default by setting **Email feed visibility** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Account Settings page.    

</span> <!-- g4s -->

<span class="sub ">

By default, the Email Feed is set to public, where non-members, or Visitors, will be able to see the email listing and view emails.  Administrators can change this default by setting **Email feed visibility** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Account Settings page.   

</span> <!-- sub -->

<span class="sub g4s">

Sub-groups can also set their own Email Feed visibility which initially defaults to the parent's setting.  A sub-group's visibility can be changed to Public, 
Account members only or Sub-group members by setting **Email feed visibility** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Sub-group 
Settings page.  Limiting the feed's visibility to Sub-group members only will privatize the sub-group's emails to its sub-group members only.

From the Email List (<img src="/docimages/listing-view-icon.png" height="22">) Administrators can override the default visibility for an individual email by clicking the email's <img src="/docimages/public-private-eye-icon.png" height="22"> to toggle between public to private.

Note

* A public Email Feed will allow Visitors to view emails that have not been specifically made private.  If a public email has Email Widgets, Visitors will be able to view the email and only its Email Widget summary images.
