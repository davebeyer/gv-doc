### What are templates and why use them

A template is a special saved email that can be used as a starting point for new emails that you send often, e.g. weekly newsletters, 
daily posts, announcements, and reports.  

Once your template has been created, it will save you the time of recreating your email's look and duplicate content each time you send 
your periodic email.

### How to create a template

Templates are created by composing the skeleton of an email with your logo, upcoming dates, links, images, etc. that you normally include 
in the email type you send.  For example, you could have a different template for announcements, reminders, and asking for feedback.
Setting up templates insures emails look basically the same and familiar with your logo, section headings, your
sign off, and subscribe link all in the same place.  Here is an example for Lighthouse View Labs:

<img src="/docimages/lighthouse-email-template.png" height="450">

To create a template, click **New Email**, compose your email, and when you're all set, click **Options** in the Compose 
header, click the **click for info** at **Advanced — Create New Template**, and click **Save this email as a new template**.

### How to make changes to a template

To make changes to a template, you will basically be creating a new template with the changes.  To start, from the **New Email** page, select 
the template from the **Templates** tab and give it a subject, which can be the same or different name.  

Make your changes and to save, click **Options** in the Compose header, click the **click for info** at **Advanced — Create New Template**, and click **Save this email as a new template**.

You can then return to the **Templates** tab to tidy up your templates by discarding old ones.

in the current group and parent group, give it a subject, and compose.
