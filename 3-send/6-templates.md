A template is an email that is set up as a starting point for new emails that are sent often, e.g. weekly newsletters. 

Templates are created by composing your email skeleton and may include your logo, dates, links, images, etc. that you normally include 
in your emails of a certain type.  For example, you could have a different template for announcements, reminders, asking for feedback, etc. 
Setting up templates insures emails will look basically the same and familiar with possibly your logo, section headings, your
sign off, and subscribe link all in the same place.  Here is an example of what one of GroupVine's templates would look like:


To create a template, click **New Email**, compose your email as your template, and when you're all set, click **Options** in the Compose 
header, and click **Save this email as a new template**.

To make changes to a template, you'll select the template from the *Templates** tab and give a subject, which can be the same or different name.  
Make your changes and save by clicking **Options** in the Compose header.  You can return to the **Templates** tab to tidy up your 
templates by discarding old ones.

To use a template, click **New Email** and select your template from the **Templates** tab, which lists the templates saved 
in the current group and parent group, give it a subject, and compose.
