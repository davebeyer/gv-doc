## Email Feed for Published Emails
<span id="gv-email-feed-for-published"/></span>

The **Email Feed** is your account’s **Home** page that visitors
will navigate to with the opportunity to subscribe.
Emails sent to the group are listed chronological, including added posts
of older emails or emails from a different service.  

The image below shows how a general member will see their
**Email Feed**, where the left side has icons to refresh the feed and to
switch from **Gallery View and Listing View JHJHJHlink-needed**.
Administrators and Editors will also have an Options filter in the Email
Feed header to include archived emails or sub-group emails, if they are
on the account feed:
