# Email Feed

## **if subscription/g4s JHJHJH** Public or Private?
<div id="gv-public-or-private"/></div>

Visitors or non-members can navigate to an account’s Email Feed,
but only emails in a public feed or emails that are individually set to
public will show up in the feed.


**If G4S  JHJHJH {**
By default, GroupVine 4 School account feeds are private to account
members, and their sub-groups default to the account’s visibility when
they are created.
Sub-group feeds can be set independently from their parent and have the
additional option to be private to their sub-group members only.
**}**

**IF SUBSCRIPTION JHJHJH {**
By default, Subscription account feeds are public, and their sub-groups default to their parent group’s visibility when they are created.  Sub-group feeds can be set independently from their parent and have the additional option to be private to their sub-group members only.
**}**

To change the visibility of an account feed, set the **Email feed
visibility** on the **Account Settings** style tab to
“Public” or “Account members only.”
This setting is also on the **Sub-group Settings** tab where
there’s also the option “Sub-group members only.”

Individual emails can also be made public from the Email Feed
regardless of your feed’s visibility by first clicking
**JHJHJHicon-needed JHJHlink-needed?** to change to Listing view and
then clicking the email’s icon **JHJHJHicon-needed JHJHlink-needed?** to
toggle through and set its visibilty.
