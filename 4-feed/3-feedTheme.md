## The Look of your Feed - Color, Logo, and Design

Your **Email Feed** page is shown with shades of its theme's primary
color and logo that are both set on the **Account Settings** or
**Sub-group Settings** tabs.  

You can also add an **Account Description** on the **Site
Customizations** tab that will show at the top of your account
and sub-group feeds.
