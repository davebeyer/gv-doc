## Gallery View, Listing View, and Email Actions

There are two ways to view the Email Feed.  By default, the Email Feeds will appear in Gallery 
view (<img src="/docimages/gallery-view-feed-icon.png" height="22">) with images of each email adding 
interest and encouraging visitors to view emails and to subscribe.
Emails in Gallery view show either response summary images if the email has Email Widgets, 
an image if any were uploaded to the email, or no images if the email was all textual.

The Email Feed can also be shown in a more condensed version by
clicking Listing view (<img src="/docimages/listing-view-icon.png" height="22">)
in the Email Feed header.  In this view, the email's visibility icon (<img src="/docimages/public-private-eye-icon.png" height="22">) can be selected
to change the email's visibility between public and private and selecting the ellipsis (<img src="/docimages/ellipsis.png" height="22">) will 
show the following actions that apply to the selected email:

* <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-download-responses.png" height="24"> downloads email's Email Widget responses, comments and other data to a spreadsheet.

* <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-view-as-recipient.png" height="24"> gives Administrators or Editors the
option to respond to the email's Email Widgets as if they were the
recipient or to email a link specifically for the recipient to respond
to the widgets.
This is useful to keep widget data together in case a recipient isn't able to respond to their email or if they convey their
response in person. 

* <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-reply-all.png" height="24"> creates a new Draft email to create a reply email and
navigates you to the email's **Compose** page. 

* <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-resend-email.png" height="22"> navigates you to the **New Email** page with the
published email selected and the resend option set to Copy.  

* <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-change-ew-settings.png" height="24"> allows you to change the email's
Email Widgets configuration.  After the next response is recorded, the new configuration will take effect.

* <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-view-delivery.png" height="22"> shows summary delivery information
(number of recipients, opens, online views, etc.) with an option to
download a spreadsheet with complete details.

* <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-archive.png" height="22"> moves the email to or from your Archive.  If archived emails are included in the Email Feed, 
<img src="/docimages/feed-menu-archive-icon.png" height="22"> will appear next to the archived email in List view.

Note

* These actions are also available from the hamburger menu (<img src="/docimages/menu-icon.png" height="22">) located in the top right corner when viewing a live email
