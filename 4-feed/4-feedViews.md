# Email Feed

<span id="gv-4feed-4feedViews"></span>
## Gallery View, Listing View, and Email Actions

By default, the Email Feeds will appear in Gallery 
view (<img src="/docimages/gallery-view-feed-icon.png" height="22">) with images from each email adding 
interest and encouraging visitors to view emails and to subscribe.
Emails in Gallery view show either response summary images if the email has Email Widgets, 
an image if any were uploaded to the email, or no images if the email was all textual.

The Email Feed can also be viewed in a more condensed version by
clicking Listing view (<img src="/docimages/listing-view-icon.png" height="22">)
in the Email Feed header.  In this view, an email's visibility icon (<img src="/docimages/public-private-eye-icon.png" height="22">) can be selected
to change its visibility between public and private and its ellipsis (<img src="/docimages/ellipsis.png" height="22">) can be selected to 
show these actions for the selected email:

* <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-download-responses.png" height="24"> downloads Email Widget responses, comments and other data to a spreadsheet.

* <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-view-as-recipient.png" height="24"> gives Administrators or Editors the
option to respond to the email's Email Widgets as if they were the
recipient or to copy to their clipboard a link specifically for the recipient and email it to the recipient so they can respond
to the widgets.
This is useful to keep widget data together in case a recipient is unable to respond to their email or if they convey their
response in person. 

* <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-reply-all.png" height="24"> creates a new reply Draft email and
navigates you to its **Compose** page. 

* <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-resend-email.png" height="22"> navigates you to the **New Email** page with the
published email selected and the resend option defaulted to *Copy published email to your new email and make changes*.  Click [here](/3-send/5-resend.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-5resend) for details on resending an email, which has important information if your email has Email Widgets.

* <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-change-ew-settings.png" height="24"> allows you to change the 
Email Widgets configuration, which are to allow recipients to view responses, allow commenting on responses, and allow names on responses to be visible.  The new configuration will take effect after the next response is recorded.

* <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-view-delivery.png" height="22"> shows summary delivery information
(number of recipients, opens, online views, etc.) with an option to
download the complete details to a spreadsheet.

* <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-archive.png" height="22"> or <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-unarchive.png" height="24"> to move the email to or from the Archive.  If archived emails are included in the Email Feed, 
<img src="/docimages/archive-icon.png" height="22"> will appear next to the archived email in List view.

Note

* These actions are also available from the email's menu (<img src="/docimages/menu-icon.png" height="22">) located in the top right corner when viewing a live email.
