# Email Feed

<span id="gv-4feed-4feedViews"/></span>
## Gallery View, Listing View, and Email Actions

By default, Email Feeds appear in Gallery View with each email showing
either Email Widget summary images if the email has Email Widgets, an
image if one was uploaded to the email, or no images if the email just
included text.
Images add interest and encourage visitors to open emails to learn about
your account and hopefully subscribe! 

For Administrators and Editors, there is also a more condensed view by
clicking the
<span class="todo">
**JHJHJHicon-needed**
</span>
in the Email Feed header to switch to
Listing View.
You’ll then see each email has a
<span class="todo">
**JHJHJHicon-needed**
</span>
icon to toggle
through and change an email’s visibility setting.
Each email also has an
**ellipsis (three vertical dots)

actions are also available from a live email’s "hamburger"
