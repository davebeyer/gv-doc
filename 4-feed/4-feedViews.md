# Email Feed

## Gallery View, Listing View, and Email Actions
<span id="gv-gallery-view"/></span>

By default, Email Feeds appear in Gallery View with each email showing
either Email Widget summary images if the email has Email Widgets, an
image if one was uploaded to the email, or no images if the email just
included text.
Images add interest and encourage visitors to open emails to learn about
your account and hopefully subscribe! 

For Administrators and Editors, there is also a more condensed view by
clicking the **JHJHJHicon-needed** in the Email Feed header to switch to
Listing View.
You’ll then see each email has a **JHJHJHicon-needed** icon to toggle
through and change an email’s visibility setting.
Each email also has an **ellipsis (three vertical dots)
JHJHJHicon-needed** to a menu of these additional email actions (these
actions are also available from a live email’s “hamburger”
**JHJHJHicon-needed** icon menu located in the top right corner
**JHJHJHof-what?**).

**JHJHJHtext-needed to introduce these bullets below:**

* Download responses downloads email’s Email Widget data to a spreadsheet.

* **View as recipient** gives Administrators or Editors the
option to respond to an email’s Email Widgets as if they were the
recipient or to email a link specifically for the recipient to respond
to the widgets.
This is useful to keep all widget data together in case a recipient
**“misplaces” JHJHJHedit-remove-quotes**? the email or conveys their
responses in person. 

* **Reply all** creates a new Draft email for a reply email and
navigates you to the email’s **Compose** page. 

* **Resend email** navigates you to the **New Email** page with the
published email selected and the resend option set to Copy.

* **Email Widget settings** allows you to change the email’s
Email Widgets configuration.
After the next response is recorded, the new configuration will take
effect.

* **View delivery data** shows summary delivery information
(number of recipients, opens, online views, etc.) with an option to
download a delivery data spreadsheet with complete details.

* **Archive/Unarchive** moves the email to or from your
Archive.
