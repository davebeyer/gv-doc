## Add Other Emails to your Feed

To add other or old emails to your Email Feed, e.g., emails sent directly or
using a different service, simply attach one or more old emails to a new
email sent with the `~post` instruction from your personal inbox to your account or sub-group.
For example, for bingotech account, send the email to:

```
~post~~bingotech@trivy.email
```

To attach old emails, first save them as an
email-message file (a file with a `.eml` suffix).
For example, in Gmail, from the email you'd like to post, 
select the "Download" option on the email's menu.
