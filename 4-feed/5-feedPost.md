# Email Feed

## Add Other Emails to your Feed
<div id="gv-add-other-emails-to-your-feed"></div>

To add other or old emails into your feed, e.g., emails sent directly or
using a different service, simply attach one or more old emails to a new
email sent with the `~post` instruction to your account or sub-group.
For example, for bingotech account, send the email to:

    `~post~~bingotech@trivy.email`

To attach old emails, you'll first need to save them into an
email-message file (a file with a `.eml` suffix).
For instance, on Gmail, go to the email that you'd like to post and
select the "Download" option on the menu for that email.
