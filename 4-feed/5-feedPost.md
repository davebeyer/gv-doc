## Add Other Emails to your Feed

To add other or old emails into your feed, e.g., emails sent directly or
using a different service, simply attach one or more old emails to a new
email sent with the `~post` instruction to your account or sub-group.
For example, for bingotech account, send the email to:

`~post~~bingotech@trivy.email`

<span class="todo">
** JHJHJH Three ways to emphasize email addresses, which looks better?
The last option ("indented") has a faint hightlight box with a little
indent, which does not show up when encased in class todo **
 
This one: **
    
`~post~~bingotech@trivy.email`

OR this one:
    
```~post~~bingotech@trivy.email```
    
OR this one:

    ~post~~bingotech@trivy.email
</span>

To attach old emails, you'll first need to save them into an
email-message file (a file with a `.eml` suffix).
For instance, on Gmail, go to the email that you'd like to post and
select the "Download" option on the menu for that email.
