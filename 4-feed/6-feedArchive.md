## Tidy Up your Feed by Archiving Emails

Archiving emails helps "tidy up" your Email Feed by removing extraneous
emails that no longer need to be viewable by your general membership or
the public.

To archive an email, view your Email Feed in Listing view (<img src="/docimages/listing-view-icon.png" height="22">), select the
email's ellipsis (<img src="/docimages/ellipsis.png" height="22">),
and select <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-archive.png" height="22"> from the menu.

To unarchive an email and return it to the Email Feed, view your feed
in Listing view (<img src="/docimages/listing-view-icon.png" height="22">), click the archived email's ellipsis (<img src="/docimages/ellipsis.png" height="22">), and select <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-unarchive1.png" height="24"> from the menu.

To include archived emails in your feed, click **Options** in the Email
Feed header and select **Include archived emails**.
In the Listing view, archived emails are identified with <img src="/docimages/archive-icon.png" height="22">
to signify they've been filed away.
