## Tidy Up your Feed by Archiving Emails
<div id="gv-tidy-up-your-feed"></div>

Archiving emails helps “tidy up” your Email Feed by removing extraneous
emails that no longer need to be viewable by your general membership or
the public.

To include archived emails in your feed, click **Options** in the Email
Feed header and select **Include archived emails**.
In the Listing View, archived emails will be identified with
**JHJHJHicon-needed** to signify it’s filed away.

To archive an email, view your Email Feed in Listing View, select the
email’s ellipsis **(three vertical dots) JHJHJHicon-needed?** and select
**Archive** from the menu.

To unarchive an email and return it to the Email Feed, view your feed
in Listing View, then click the archived email’s **ellipsis (three
vertical dots) JHJHJHicon-needed?** and select **Unarchive** from the
menu.
