Notes:

* questions and recipient responses, all within an email.

* Recipients respond and comment on Email Widgets right from their email.

* Recipients see up-to-date images that summarize Email Widget response in their email.

* [TBD] From the list of responses, Administrators and Editors can email a recipient or a group of recipients who have either responded, have yet to respond, or responded with a specific answer.

* [TBD] Recipients can comment on responses which sends an email notifying others in the response thread of the new comment.  Commenting can be a time-saver
because it’s a convenient way to send confirmations, share ideas, request more information, and “get back” to someone without having to look up their email address.

Email Widgets are a simple and powerful tool that make it easy to ask questions, collect information, start conversations and gather feedback right in an email.  From their inbox, recipients can add responses and comments and see up-to-date images that summarize Email Widget responses.  

Email Widgets can be used for almost anything you would like to ask your community: votes, polls, help requests, RSVPs, as well as soliciting opinions and comments, all which make it possible to engage your community in a discussion, embedded within the email, around these questions.

Email Widgets transform email for groups and communities into dynamic and engaging communications, and enhance the value (for recipients and senders) of each communication you send and drive greater participation and interaction from your community.

Here are some key Email Widget features:

* From the email Administrators and Editors can download up-to-date Email Widget detailed data to a 
spreadsheet.

* Recipients can respond and comment from their email without signing-in or clicking-through to a survey, online document, or “invitation site.” 

* In real-time and right from their email, recipients can see how others are responding and view up-to-date images that summarize responses.

* Responses and comments can be hidden from recipients in case a response is determined to be inappropriate. 

* Email notifications are sent to all response participants when a new comment is added to that thread.

* To keep all response information in one email, future recipients will be able to respond to a published email's Email Widgets when they’re added to the email's recipient list.  For example, newly added account members can respond to an email previously published to the entire community.

* Visitors can view summary images for public emails with Email Widgets.
