Email Widgets are questions added right to your email asking recipients for information, which could be votes, polls, help requests, and RSVPs, 
as well as soliciting 
opinions and comments.  Also with commenting capabilities, where recipients can add comments to other responses, it's possible to engage your community 
in a discussion, embedded right in the email.  

Here are the different types of Email Widgets that can be included in emails when sending from your online account or personal email account:

* **Text** for a free form text response

Note

* The color of the summary images are based on shades of your group's primary [theme color](/3-send/4-sendSettings.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-4sendsettings-theme-colors).

* Double click on a widget to change its defaults and to configure widgets email-wide.  It's important to give your widget a name to briefly describes it's purpose.  The name is used in several places:  the caption to the widget's summary image's in the Email Feed, the column label when responses are downloaded to a spreadsheet, and the widget's description when hovering over its response in the reponse listing.  Email Widget names are limited to 32 characters.
