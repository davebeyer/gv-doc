### Download Email Widget Responses & Comments

At any time, Administrators and Editors have easy access to an email's up-to-date Email Widget responses and comments by downloading a spreadsheet from the email.  Having this data "stored" with the email eliminates the manual process of plowing through email replies or keeping another spreadsheet up to date.  To download 
an email's widget data:

* View the Email Feed in Listing view (<img src="/docimages/listing-view-icon.png" height="22">) and locate your email.
* Click on the email's ellipsis (<img src="/docimages/ellipsis.png" height="22">) and select <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-download-responses.png" height="24">.

### Hide Inappropriate Responses

In case there's a response that is inappropriate or doesn't belong, Administrators and Editors can hide the response from the response listing.  The response will still be in the listing, but only Admistrators and Editors will see the greyed version, which means it is hidden.  

This is how a recipient's response looks in the response listing.  Click "Hide" in the bottom left corner will hide this response from the response listing.

This is the greyed version after the response is hidden.  Click "Unhide" will change the response to be visible again in the response listing.

### Configure Email Widget to Affect Response Listing

The response listing shows an email's Email Widget responses and can be viewed by email recipients when they view the email online.  

These three settings affect the response listing and apply to all Email Widgets in an email:

* **Allow response listing?** When selected, the response listing can be viewed by email recipients when viewing the email online.  Otherwise, recipients can only view the summary images and signed-in Editor recipients and all signed-in Admins will still be able to view the listing from the email online.

* **Commenting allowed on responses?** This option is only applicable if "Allow response listing" is enabled.

* **Names are visible?** When selected and "Allow response listing?" is enabled, the responder's name is included in the response listing as it's set in their Profile.  Even if not selected, names will still appear in the summary images for Text Email Widgets.

The configuration values have default values that are set under Email Widget Defaults on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> Account Settings page.  However, these settings can be overridden for an email by double-clicking an Email Widget in the email and then clicking the Email-wide Settings tab to make changes.
