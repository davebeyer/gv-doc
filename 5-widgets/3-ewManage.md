### Download Email Widget Responses & Comments

At any time, Administrators and Editors have easy access to an email's up-to-date Email Widget responses and comments by downloading a spreadsheet from the email.  Having this data always accessible from the email eliminates the manual process of plowing through email replies and maintaining a spreadsheet which could introduce errors.  To download 
an email's widget data:

* View the Email Feed in Listing view (<img src="/docimages/listing-view-icon.png" height="22">) and locate your email.
* Click on the email's ellipsis (<img src="/docimages/ellipsis.png" height="22">) and select <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-download-responses.png" height="24">.

This can also be done when viewing the online email and making the selection from the email's menu (<img src="/docimages/menu-icon.png" height="22">).

### Report Inappropriate Comments

Recipients can report on a comment they feel is inappropriate by clicking "Report" and submitting a brief explanation of the issue.  

<img src="/docimages/ew-report-comment.png" height="180">

Editors and Administrators in the group will receive an email notifying them of a possible inappropriate comment along with the time of the report, the explanation, and the comment that was reported on.  The email will also contain a link to the email to possibly hide the comment.

### Hide Inappropriate Responses or Comments

If a response or comment is found to be inappropriate or out of place, Administrators and Editors can hide the response or comment from the response listing.  The response or comment is still in the listing, but only Admistrators and Editors are able to see the hidden greyed version.  

This is how the recipient's response looks in the response listing.  Click "Hide" in the bottom left corner to hide the response from the response listing.

<img src="/docimages/ew-response-hide.png" height="150">

Below is the greyed version after the response is hidden.  Click "Unhide" in the bottom left corner to show the response in the response listing.

<img src="/docimages/ew-response-unhide.png" height="150">

Similarly, Administrators and Editors can click "Hide" to remove a comment from the listing, in this case to keep the phone number private, and click "Unhide" of the greyed hidden comment to return it to the response listing.

### Configure Settings for Email Widget Response Listing

The response listing shows the responses to the email's Email Widget and can be seen by recipients when the email is viewed online.  

These three settings affect the response listing and apply to all Email Widgets in an email:

<img src="/docimages/email-config-ew.png" height="250">

* **Allow response listing?** When enabled, the response listing is available to recipients by clicking to view the live email or clicking an Email Widget from their inbox to get to the email online, otherwise only the widget summary images are shown.  If disabled, signed-in Editor recipients and all signed-in Admins are still able to view the listing from the email online.

* **Commenting allowed on responses?** This option is only applicable if *Allow response listing?* is enabled.

* **Names are visible?** When selected and *Allow response listing?* is enabled, the responder's name is included in the response listing as it's set in their Profile.  If not selected, names still appear in the summary image for Text Email Widgets.

The configuration values have default values that are set under **Email Widget Defaults** on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Account Settings** page.  However, these settings can be overridden for an email by double-clicking an Email Widget in the email editor and then clicking the **Email-wide Settings** tab to make changes.

### Change Email Widget Configuration After Email is Published

After an email is published, changes to the Email Widget Configuration can still be done by doing the following:

* View the Email Feed in Listing view (<img src="/docimages/listing-view-icon.png" height="22">) and locate your email.

* Click on the email's ellipsis (<img src="/docimages/ellipsis.png" height="22">) and select <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-change-ew-settings.png" height="22">.

<img src="/docimages/feed-config-ew-popup.png" height="240">

* Make your changes and click `Save`.  The 

This can also be done when viewing the online email and making the selection from the email's menu (<img src="/docimages/menu-icon.png" height="22">).

### Add Response as Recipient to Email Widget

A benefit to using Email Widgets is having all of the collected data kept with the email in your feed, so it's accessible anytime. But what if instead of submitting their responses, a recipient tells an Administrator or Editor their responses in person or possibly misplaces the email so they are unable to respond.  Here's is what you can do:

* View the Email Feed in Listing view (<img src="/docimages/listing-view-icon.png" height="22">) and locate your email.

* Click on the email's ellipsis (<img src="/docimages/ellipsis.png" height="22">) and select <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-view-as-recipient.png" height="22">.

<img src="/docimages/feed-view-as-rec-popup.png" height="190">

* Search for the recipient and select the correct match.

* If the recipient conveyed their responses in person, click **Switch to Recipient**.  You will be signed out and the recipient's email page will be shown (note, in the top right corner, it should say "Viewing as").  You can proceed to respond to the Email Widgets as instructed by the recipient.

* If the recipient misplaced their email, click **Copy Link to Clipboard** and paste the link into a new email in your personal inbox and email it to the recipient with instructions to click the link and submit their responses.

This can also be done when viewing the online email and making the selection from the email's menu (<img src="/docimages/menu-icon.png" height="22">).
