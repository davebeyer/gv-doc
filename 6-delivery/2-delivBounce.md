## What are bounced emails?

* [What to do when email addresses bounce?](#gv-6delivery-2delivBounce-what-to-do)

A bounced email is an email that could not be delivered to
the recipient's email address which usually occurs because the email
address was incorrect or a recipient's mailbox is full.  Once an
address has bounced twice, it is "bounced out" and considered a "problem" address ([what's this?](/6-delivery/4-delivProblems.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]gv-6delivery-4delivProblems-problem-addr)).

After sending an email from an online account or from
a personal inbox, if there were any failed
deliveries, an "Email delivery report" from "GV-BRAND Worker
Bee" is emailed to the sender with a list of bounced
email addresses and the reason for the bounce.  If all
deliveries were successful, then a delivery report will
not be sent.

## What to do when email addresses bounce?

For bounced email addresses, the goal is to correct
the addresses in your account and then resend the email to
those corrected addresses.  Here's how to do that:

* Confirm the correctness of the email address and update their address from the Membership's Member Listing page.  Make a note of the corrected addresses to resend to these members.

* View the Email Feed in Listing view (<img src="/docimages/listing-view-icon.png" height="22">) and locate your email.

* Click the email's ellipsis (<img src="/docimages/ellipsis.png" height="22">) and select <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-resend-email.png" height="22">.

* On the New Email page select the option `Resend published email without any changes` and click `Review and Send`.  If email changes
 are needed, then select `Copy published email to your new email` instead, enter a subject and click `Compose`.
 
* When ready, click `Send`, select the Select Individuals tab and select those members whose address you corrected.  

* Click `Resend!`

The Resend option can also be selected by viewing the online email and making the selection from the email's menu (<img src="/docimages/menu-icon.png" height="22">).
