## What are "Bounced out" or "problem" email addresses?

Once a member's email address has bounced twice, it's
considered a "problem" address and the address has
"bounced out" where we no longer attempt to deliver
emails to that address.  

This is done to keep us in good standing with email
service providers so they don't consider us spammers
and will continue to accept and deliver our emails
to their customers' inboxes.
