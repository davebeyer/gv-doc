## View and download detailed email delivery information

To view and download an email's detailed email delivery information:

* View the Email Feed in Listing view (<img src="/docimages/listing-view-icon.png" height="22">) and locate your email.

* Click on the email's ellipsis (<img src="/docimages/ellipsis.png" height="22">) and select <img src="/docimages/feed-menu-view-delivery.png" height="24">.  The Delivery Data overlay will show some high level stats, any failed or bounced addresses, and when recipients opened the email graphed over time.

* Click `Download Delivery Data` to download all delivery details to a spreadsheet.

This can also be done when viewing the online email and making the selection from the email's menu (<img src="/docimages/menu-icon.png" height="22">).
