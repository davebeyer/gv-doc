GoLocal is a fantastic way for businesses and other
organizations to promote themselves to their local
community, and it makes the school community happy to
see that the national ads in their emails have been
replaced with promotions by more friendly and relevant
local merchants. And unlike print advertising, each
email has only two ads, so yours will get plenty of
attention!

## Ad Image Types and Specifications

GroupVine 4 School communities can send emails using one of the
following two basic template formats.

  <div style="margin:20px auto; text-align:center">
    <img src="/docimages/golocal-side-ads.jpg" width="70%">
    <div style="display:inline-block">Template One - Ads on the side</div>
  </div>

  <div style="margin:20px auto; text-align:center">
    <img src="/docimages/golocal-top-ads.png" width="70%">
    <div style="display:inline-block">Template Two - Ads in the top banner</div>
  </div>
     
The two Top Banner ads and the Side Square ad are
“Standard” ads, and priced the same. The Side Skyscraper
ad is a “Premium” ad, and priced 50% higher than the
Standard ads (see pricing below).

To ensure that your ad runs continuously, regardless of
which template the School chooses for their emails, we
suggest providing at least one ad image for Template One
and one for Template Two.

## GoLocal Pricing

Because of our goal to replace the national ads with more
friendly and relevant local promotions in as many of the
communities across the country as possible, we’ve set our
pricing to be extremely competitive with local
alternatives, particularly given that we only charge your
account when the email that includes your ad is viewed by
a recipient, and that each email only includes two ads.

Pricing is based on “View Credits,” which account for the
number of times email recipients view an email with your
ad(s) displayed. Each time a recipient views one of your
ads, the account associated with that ad is charged 1 View
Credit for a Standard ad, or 1.5 View Credits for a
Premier ad. Only the Side Skyscraper ad described above is
considered a Premier ad type, all others are Standard ads.

View Credit pricing is as follows (please

    <td>20,000</td>
    <td>28%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that by using View Credits, we ensure that your
account will only be charged when your ad is actually
viewed.

To start running your ad, we’ll email you an invoice using
PayPal (which accepts all major credit cards). After
receiving your payment, your ad should typically be ready
within 24 hours to be begin running in the next emails
sent by the school communities you have specified!

## GoLocal FAQ

* **Can I advertise to more than one school community?**
Yes, just let us know which schools your’d like to target and we can include your ad in their community emails.

* **What statistics are included in the monthly activity reports?**
Each GoLocal advertiser will receive a monthly report 
that shows, for each active ad: 1) The total number of
views and clicks for your ad during the month, and; 2) The
number of view credits remaining in your account.

* **What if there are more advertisers than ad slots available?**
If this is the case, then ads will be fairly rotated.

* **Can I change my ad once I make a payment?**
Yes!  You can update a particular ad image as frequently as every month.

* **What if I only provide only one ad image for one of
the email templates, and the school sends some emails using the
other email template?**
Your account is only charged when ads are included in an
email and viewed, so in this case, your account will not
be charged.  We suggest providing ad images for both
templates so your ad will be rotated through the ad slots
regardless of the template used.

* **What image formats are supported for the ads?**
Ad images should be provided using JPG, PNG, or GIF image
formats.  If you provide an ad image in a different
format, we can typically convert it for you.  Note that
animated GIFs are generally not supported, as they do not
work in many email readers.

* **What is the file size limit for the ad images?**
The file size for ad images should be no more than 150
kBytes.  If you provide a larger ad image file, we can
typically reduce it for you.
