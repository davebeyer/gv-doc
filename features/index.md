# New Features:

## Archiving emails
## Custom attributes
## Better-integrated email widgets [need to be more precise here]
## keep listing...


# Migration Notes:

## use <community>.groupvine.com rather than
   www.groupvine.com/<community> for web pages.  Main account and
   sub-group email addresses remain unchanged.  List addresses are
   simpler (like <listname>~~<community>@groupvine.com)

## Say goodbye to the "notes" field and fixed address fields in import
   files and member profile pages.  Now custom attributes can be
   defined to hold whatever makes sense for your community, and are
   imported, exported, and otherwise managed just like any of the old
   fixed attributes.
