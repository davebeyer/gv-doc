## Posting old emails

To add old emails into your gallery (e.g., emails sent directly or
using a different service), simply attach one or more old emails to a
new email sent with the ```~post``` instruction to your account (or
sub-group).  For example, for bingotech account, send the email to:

```
   ~post~~bingotech@groupvine.email
```

To attach your old emails, you'll first need to save them into an email-message file
(a file with a ```.eml``` suffix).  For instance, on gmail, go to the email
that you'd like to post and select the "Download" option the menu for that email.
