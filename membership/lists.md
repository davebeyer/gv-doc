# Membership Lists

For the more adventerous, lists give you flexibility in how you can
target email recipients.  Lists can:

* Allow cross-account identification of your members
* Can easily be added in membership imports
* Are available to all sub-groups below the group where the list is
  defined (e.g., a list defined in the main group account are available
  to all sub-groups).

## Example

For example, for an account named "bingotech", you might wish to
classify your BingoTech followers using Lists to identify some of
their interests, such as "golfers" and "musicians".  You could then
send an email to all the musicians using the address:

```
~list=musiclovers~~bingotech@trivy.email
```
