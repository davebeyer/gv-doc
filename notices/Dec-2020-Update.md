## Search your Email Feed

You can now search your Email Feed for matching words or word
combinations.

**Show image of search input with example search, like "birds OR
  reptiles" along with arrow to "Search" link to open the search panel**

The Subject, From address, and email content for each email in your
Email Feed will searched and matching results will be listed in order
of best matches.  (Emails with equivalent matching word density are then
ordered by most recent emails first.)

If you enter more than one word, only emails that include both words
will be listed.  For more complex searches, the special terms AND, OR,
and NOT can be used and combined, along with parentheses.  For
example:

```
   (oil industry) AND (climate OR renewable)
```

Common words such as the, but, by, very, because, this, that, etc.,
and search strings less than 3 characters will be ignored.

## Email Feed listing groups emails by thread

The listing view of your Email Feed now groups emails by "threads."
This means that all replies or resends of an email will be grouped
into a single line in your Email Feed listing.

_Show example listing with a couple grouped threads_

An email thread can be expanded into the individual emails by clicking
on the "+".

_Previous example with one of the threads expanded_

The threading only groups emails if the Subject hasn't been altered.
A changed Subject is used as an indication that the sender wishes
the email to be considered as the start of a separate thread, even
if it was in reply to another email.

## Online directory for your membership

A new setting on your Account Settings page allows you to make basic
membership information accessible as an online directory for your
signed in Editors, or even to your general membership accessing your
Email Feed or their Profile page using the private links
in a received email.

The setting has the following choices:

_image with showing menu with: Admins Only, Editors & Admins, and All members_

Also, members will see a new menu on their profile page to allow them
to customize what information of theirs would be visible from this
online directory:

_image with showing menu with: None (Admin access only), Name only, Name & Email, Name, Email & Phone_

New members will have their membership visiblity choice defaulted to
Name & Email.

Existing members at the date of this release will have their personal
visibility set to None.  (Please let us know if you have obtained
prior permission from your membership and think this default for
existing members should be modified for your account.)

If the account is configured to allow "All members" to view the
membership information online, it may be worthwhile reminding your
membership to avoid forwarding received emails to non community
members to avoid giving others access to the online membership using
the private links in the community emails.

## Other Noteworthy Changes since the August 2020 GroupVine20 Upgrade

* By default, emails sent to the community from a sender's personal
  inbox require the sender to confirm the email before it is delivered
  to the community.  This sender-confirmation security step can now be
  optionally disabled on the Account Settings page.

* You can now download a template membership file for your account on
  the Membership Upload & Export page, to make it easier to create and
  upload new membership additions or changes using a membership import file.

* When adding a new member on the "Add New Member" membership page,
  the new member information (beyond name, email address and role) can
  be immediately edited on that page.

* Online email editor updated to include more font choices: Arial Black,
  Comic Sans MS, Impact, Ubuntu, and Ubunto Mono.

* Image handling updated in online email editor to make it easier to insert
  text immediately before and after, and to add more scaling options.

* Manage Lists page in sub-groups now also list the lists defined and managed
  at the Account level for informational purposes.

* Email notifications are now regularly sent to account Admins when
  there are pending membership applications.  The frequency of these
  notifications can be controlled on the Account Settings page.

* Add support for numeric-only list names (like "2020", "20201").
