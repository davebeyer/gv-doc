# V20 Upgrade FAQ

Here are some changes to be aware of with the July 2020 upgrade to
GroupVine20.

### Documentation

### Confirmation Required for Emails from Personal Inbox to Unmoderated Groups 

Confirm emails sent from your personal inbox to unmoderated groups
Spammers are sometimes able to highjack personal email addresses, and
then send spam to all of that person's contacts, including the
GroupVine email communities they are able to send to.  To help avoid
this risk, when emails are sent from your personal inbox to any
account or sub-group address that isn't already being moderated, the
GroupVine20 system will immediately respond with a Confirmation
request email to confirm that the email is legitimate.  Also, all
bounce message reports are sent to the sender.

### Account web address got an upgrade

to http://myacount.groupvine.com. To sign in, add "/signin" to the
address or click the user menu in the top right corner of your home
page.  Update your bookmarks!

### Shared email addresses

Although members can have multiple addresses, any given address
can no longer be shared between multiple members (or even between
multiple "user" accounts across the GroupVine20 system).  If an
address was being shared between two of your members before, it
has likely been assigned to one of them.

### Display names

Display names, or what appears in the "From" portion of a sent email,
is your First Name and Last Name, which can be set for each
GroupVine20 account that you're a sender in.

### Unused alternate email address have not been migrated

If the "Do not send to my alternate email address" flag was set to
"No," then this email address was not migrated into the GroupVineV20
system (which does not have this flag).  If you would like to store
and track these email addresses anyway in your account, one option
would be to create a Custom Attribute named "Unused Alt Email" (for
example) and store it there.  Contact us if you'd like help or would
like to migrate these previously unused addresses into an attribute
like that.

### List email address have changed

Attention only needed if you send to specific lists from your personal inbox

list email address have become simpler.  For example, the new list
address will be

'ListAddress++AccountName@groupvine.com'

Instead of

'list=ListAddress~~AccountName@groupvine.com'

### List names

List names now require at least one letter (pure numbers are reserved
by the system for identifying lists and groups in a numeric-only way).
So, for example, if you had a list previously named "2021", it has
been changed to "2021list).
