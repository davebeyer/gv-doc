your feed, but the contents of the feed can be made public or private, or you could have specific emails made public in a private Email Feed

to satisfy your account's specific needs.  Add a number, text, checkbox or single/multiple choice value attributes on your <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22">**Member Attributes** page.

Attributes can also be used to personalize emails or target recipients with specified attribute values set in their Profile.

### Shared email addresses between GroupVine20 users is no longer allowed

Although members can have multiple addresses, any given address is required to be uniquely assigned to only one user
in the GroupVine20 system, so addresses can no longer be shared.

If an address was being shared between two members, it was likely assigned to one of them.

If a member had both a primary and alternate email address, and one of those email addresses was shared, then
most likely, the email addresses were assigned to separate users.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-dispname"></span>
### How to set your Display Name

Your Display name, which appears in the "From" portion of a sent email,
is your First Name and Last Name in your Profile.  A different Display name can be set for each
GroupVine20 account where you are a sender.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-listname"></span>
### List name change for list names without a letter

List names now require at least one letter (pure numbers are reserved
by the system for identifying lists and groups in a numeric-only way).
So, for example, if you had a list previously named "2021", it has
been changed to "2021list).

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-custapppage"></span>
### Customize member Profile where members can set attribute values and join list and sub-groups
Help set up Profile - what attributes are available for members to set
and what lists and sub-groups are available for members to join from
their Profile.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-welcomeemails"></span>
### Option to send Welcome emails

## Sending Email

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-sendemail-confemail"></span>
### Confirmation Required for Emails from Personal Inbox to Unmoderated Groups 

Confirm emails sent from your personal inbox to unmoderated groups
Spammers are sometimes able to highjack personal email addresses, and
then send spam to all of that person's contacts, including the
GroupVine email communities they are able to send to.  To help avoid
this risk, when emails are sent from your personal inbox to any
account or sub-group address that isn't already being moderated, the
GroupVine20 system will immediately respond with a Confirmation
request email to confirm that the email is legitimate.  Also, all
bounce message reports are sent to the sender.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-sendemail-listaddr"></span>
### Email address to send to a list has changed

This only needs your attention if you email to a list where its email address is saved in your personal email account's contacts.  Updating the
list's email address in your contacts is all that's needed to continue to easily use a saved address in your contacts.

The change to the email address was done to make the list address simpler, for example, the new list address will be

```
ListAddress~~AccountName@groupvine.com
```

Instead of

```
list=ListAddress++AccountName@groupvine.com
```

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-unusedalts"></span>
### Unused alternate email address were not migrated

For users who had "Do not send to my alternate email address" set to
"No" in their profile, then this email address was not migrated into the GroupVineV20
system, which does not have this setting.  

If you would like to save these email addresses in your GroupVine20 account, one option
would be to create a Custom Attribute on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22">**Member Attributes** page named, for example, "Unused Alt Email" and store the address there.   

Contact us if you have any questions or would like help setting this up.
