You will also have the option to set an individual email to private in a public feed or an individual email to public in a private Email Feed.

## Membership

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-mem-attrs"></span>
### New! Create customized attributes to save member info to fit your account needs 

Use member attributes, which can be a number, text, a checkbox or single/multiple choice values, to save custom information about your members 
to satisfy your account's specific needs.  Click [here](/2-members/4-membersAttributes.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-4membersattributes) to learn more
about attributes.

Attributes can also be used to personalize emails or target recipients who have a specified attribute values 
set in their Profile.  To personalize your email using attributes, click [here](/3-send/1-sendOnline.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-1sendOnline-useattrs) 
if you're composing your email in your online account or click [here](/3-send/2-sendInbox.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-2sendInbox-useattrs) 
if you're sending from your personal inbox.  To target recipients using attribute values,

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-custapppage"></span>

### New! Customizable Profile allows members to set values to attributes and join lists and sub-groups

The [Profile](/2-members/5-membersProfile.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-5membersprofile) can be set up by the Account Administrator to suit what works for their account.  Which attributes, lists and sub-groups are available on the Profile is determined by how the **Member Profile Page** 
on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Site Customizations** page is set up by the Account Administrator. 

When members visit their Profile, they themselves can set values to the attributes or join the lists and sub-groups that appear on their Profile.  Since members can now set and join, the Profile replaces an account's customized application page.  Contact us if you would like help setting this up!

### New! Customizable Profile allows members to set values to attributes and join lists

The [Profile](/2-members/5-membersProfile.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-5membersprofile) can be set up by the Account Administrator to suit what works for their account.  Which attributes and lists are available on the Profile is determined by how the **Member Profile Page** 
on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Site Customizations** page is set up by the Account Administrator. 

When members visit their Profile, they themselves can set values to the attributes or join the lists that appear on their Profile.  Since members can now set and join, the Profile replaces an account's customized application page.  Contact us if you would like help setting this up!

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-embedsignup"></span>
### New! Embedded new member sign-up to add to your own website

We have provided HTML code to add to your website so visitors can subscribe to emails from your web pages.  This code can be reached by clicking to display the code at the bottom of the **Membership**'s **Add New Member** page. 

<span id="v20upgrade-FAQ-mem-upload"></span>
### Uploading a file defaults to changing membership as reflected in the import file

A member's attribute values, role, and memberships to lists and sub-groups are set based on the values of these columns in the uploaded file. 
An empty cell will remove an attribute value or remove the member from a list or sub-group, and an empty cell in the "Role" column will remove 
the member from the account.

Columns not included in the upload file are unaffected when the file is uploaded.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-shareemails"></span>
### Shared email addresses between GroupVine20 users is no longer allowed

Although members can have multiple addresses, any given address is required to be uniquely assigned to only one user
in the GroupVine20 system, so addresses can no longer be shared.

If an address was being shared between two members, it was likely assigned to one of them.

If a member had both a primary and alternate email address, and one of those email addresses was shared, then
most likely, the email addresses were assigned to separate users.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-dispname"></span>
### How to set your Display Name

Your Display name, which appears in the "From" portion of a sent email,
is your First Name and Last Name in your Profile.  A different Display name can be set for each
GroupVine20 account where you are a sender.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-listname"></span>
### List name change for list names without a letter

List names now require at least one letter (pure numbers are reserved
by the system for identifying lists and groups in a numeric-only way).
For example, if you had a list previously named "2021", it has
been changed to "2021list").

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-unusedalts"></span>
### Unused alternate email address were not migrated

If a member's profile had "Always copy alternate address?" set to "No" in our old system, then this email address was not migrated into the GroupVineV20
system, which does not have this setting.  

If you would like to save these email addresses in your GroupVine20 account, one option is to 
create a Custom Attribute on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22">**Member Attributes** page and for example, name it "Unused Alt Email" and store the address there.    

Contact us if you have any questions or would like help setting this up.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-welcomeemails"></span>
### Option to email new members a Welcome email, which is currently turned on

On our old system when a new member was added, there was an option to send them a "how-to" email with 
information on how to send email to the group, if the group allowed general group members to send.

In GroupVine20, at a minimum welcome emails will include a link to the member's Profile and to the account's Email Feed, and will include
how to send to the group, if the group allows for that.  An advantage to sending welcome emails is to 
give members easy access to their Profile, where they can set attribute values and join lists and sub-groups.

Currently migrated accounts have welcome emails sent and this can be changed by 
setting *Always send welcome emails?* on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22">**Account Settings** page.  

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-sendemail"></span>
## Sending Email

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-sendemail-confemail"></span>
### New! Confirmation Required for Emails from Personal Inbox to Unmoderated Groups

Spammers are sometimes able to highjack personal email addresses, and
then send spam to all of that person's contacts, including the
GroupVine email communities they are able to send to.  To help avoid
this risk, when emails are sent from your personal inbox to any
account or sub-group address that isn't already being moderated, the
GroupVine20 system will immediately respond with a Confirmation
request email to confirm that the email is legitimate.  Also, all
bounce message reports are sent to the sender.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-sendemail-templates"></span>
### New! Templates make it faster and easier to compose periodic emails

A template is a special saved email that can be used as a 
starting point for new emails that you send often, e.g. weekly newsletters, 
daily posts, announcements, and reports.  Once your 
template is set up, using them will save you the time of 
recreating your email's look and basic content each time you 
send your periodic email.

Click [here](/3-send/5-resend.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-6templates) for more information on creating and using templates.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-sendemail-ewsattrsinbox"></span>
### New! Email Widgets and attributes can be added to an email sent from a personal inbox

Email Widgets are a simple and powerful tool that make it easy 
to ask questions, collect information, start conversations and 
gather feedback right in an email. From their inbox, recipients 
can add responses and comments and see up-to-date images that 
summarize Email Widget responses.  For a further introduction 
and more information on Email Widgets, click [here](/5-widgets/1-ewIntro.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-5widgets-1ewintro)
and to include Email Widgets to emails created from an inbox, 
click [here](/3-send/2-sendInbox.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-2sendInbox-useattrs)

Custom Attributes are used to save member information that is 
specific to your account.  Attributes can be added to your emails
to personalize them with the recipient's attribute values.
For more information about 
Attributes, click [here](/2-members/4-membersAttributes.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-4membersattributes)
and to add attributes to an email created from an inbox,
click [here](/3-send/2-sendInbox.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-2sendInbox-useattrs).

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-sendemail-ews"></span>
### Email Widgets upgrade: easy add from editor menu, faster, and Submit button is gone!

Email Widgets are a simple and powerful tool that make it easy to ask questions, collect information, start conversations and gather feedback right in an email. From their inbox, recipients can add responses and comments and see up-to-date images that summarize Email Widget responses.

Email Widgets got an upgrade so they're super easy to add from the editor menu, and they're faster and more responsive when viewing responses.

Try sending an email with some Email Widgets to yourself and a few others to check out how they look 
in your email and from your Email Feed.  Then respond and maybe change your response, and add some comments.  Anyone viewing their response listing will get udpated in real-time with new or changed responses, as will the summary images. If you added a comment, everyone in that response's thread will receive an email notifying them of the comment.  Finally, download responses to
see up-to-date responses and comments, and more :)

For more details on Email Widgets, click [here](/5-widgets/1-ewIntro.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-5widgets-1ewintro) and to add 
a widget to your online email, click [here](/3-send/1-sendOnline.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-1sendOnline-useews).

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-sendemail-listaddr"></span>
### List email addresses have changed - update your contacts!

This only needs your attention if you email to a list where its email address is saved in your personal email account's contacts.  Updating the
list's email address in your contacts is all that's needed to continue to easily use a saved address in your contacts.

The change to the email address was done to make the list address simpler, for example, the new list address will be

```
ListAddress~~AccountName@groupvine.com
```

Instead of

```
list=ListAddress++AccountName@groupvine.com
```

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-sendemail-resend"></span>
### Resending an email with Email Widgets

By default, resending an email is done without any changes, or "as is," which is important if your email has Email Widgets.
By sending "as is" Email Widget responses collected with the resend will stay grouped together with the original email, 
as well as with other "as is" resends of the same email.  This is probably the most common choice since a resend is usually 
sent to missed or new recipients.

If resending is done as a copy, and the email has Email Widgets, then responses will be separate from the original email
and any of its resends, and will have its own data set.  

For more information on resending emails, click [here](/3-send/5-resend.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-5resend).

## Subscription Accounts

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-subs-listaddr"></span>
### How to sign up

To sign up or upgrade your account, go to your <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22">**Subscription Status** page and click the link to review features and sign up!

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-subs-migration"></span>
### Subscription account migration

<span class="todo">

Subscription accounts:  Service Type, due dates, free month, sign up by 9/1 on new system
 
For the upgrade, your account will be transferred to a similar Subscription account and we've 
extended your expiration date to give you a free month before needing to sign up. We will be 
canceling your subscription with our old service as of August 1, 2020 and you will be refunded any outstanding 
balance to the credit card on file.  To sign up, go to the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22">**Subscription Status** page and 
click the link to review features and sign up.
 
</span> <!-- todo -->

GroupVine20 will be using Braintree as our new payment service for subscription accounts and we'll work
together to get everyone transferred over.  

Current subscription accounts will at the very least be grandfathered in at their current rate, but some 
accounts will actually see a decrease in cost (!) or an increase in account member size (!).  

Accounts were migrated to a similar Subscription service level and GroupVine extended your expiration date to 9/1/20 to 
give you a free month of service before you will need to sign up.
