### Confirmation Required for Emails from Personal Inbox to Unmoderated Groups 

Confirm emails sent from your personal inbox to unmoderated groups
Spammers are sometimes able to highjack personal email addresses, and
then send spam to all of that person's contacts, including the
GroupVine email communities they are able to send to.  To help avoid
this risk, when emails are sent from your personal inbox to any
account or sub-group address that isn't already being moderated, the
GroupVine20 system will immediately respond with a Confirmation
request email to confirm that the email is legitimate.  Also, all
bounce message reports are sent to the sender.

### Account web address got an upgrade

Your GroupVine20 web address has been upgraded to http://*myacount*.groupvine.com, which takes you to your Email Feed. 

### How to sign in

To sign in, navigate to your home page, http://*myacount*.groupvine.com, which is your Email Feed, and click the **Visitor** menu 
in the top right corner of the page.  

To sign directory into your account, you can add "/signin" to your home address, http://*myacount*.groupvine.com.

### Shared email addresses

Although members can have multiple addresses, any given address is required to be uniquely assigned to only one user
in the GroupVine20 system, so addresses can no longer be shared.

If an address was being shared between two members, it was likely assigned to one of them.

If a member had both a primary and alternate email address, and one of those email addresses was shared, then
most likely, the email addresses were assigned to separate users.

### Display names

Display names, or what appears in the "From" portion of a sent email,
is your First Name and Last Name, which can be set for each
GroupVine20 account that you're a sender in.

### Unused alternate email address have not been migrated

If the "Do not send to my alternate email address" flag was set to
"No," then this email address was not migrated into the GroupVineV20
system (which does not have this flag).  If you would like to store
and track these email addresses anyway in your account, one option
would be to create a Custom Attribute named "Unused Alt Email" (for
example) and store it there.  Contact us if you'd like help or would
like to migrate these previously unused addresses into an attribute
like that.

### List email address have changed

Attention only needed if you send to specific lists from your personal inbox

list email address have become simpler.  For example, the new list
address will be

'ListAddress++AccountName@groupvine.com'

Instead of

'list=ListAddress~~AccountName@groupvine.com'

### List names

List names now require at least one letter (pure numbers are reserved
by the system for identifying lists and groups in a numeric-only way).
So, for example, if you had a list previously named "2021", it has
been changed to "2021list).
