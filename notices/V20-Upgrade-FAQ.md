### New! Your Email Feed and new home page

Your Email Feed and home page is at *http://myacount.groupvine.com* and lists your published emails.  Your Email Feed can be set to public so Visitors

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-mem"></span>
## Membership

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-mem-attrs"></span>
### New! Create customized attributes to save member info to fit your account needs 
Use member attributes, which can be a number, text, a checkbox or single/multiple choice values, to save custom information about your members 
to satisfy your account's specific needs.  Add a number, text, checkbox or single/multiple choice value attributes on your <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22">**Member Attributes** page.

Attributes can also be used to personalize emails or target recipients with specified attribute values set in their Profile.  
To personalize your email using attributes, click [here](/3-send/1-sendOnline.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-1sendOnline-useattrs) 
if you're composing your email in your online account or click [here](/3-send/2-sendInbox.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-2sendInbox-useattrs) 
if you're sending from your personal inbox.  And then to target recipients using attribute values, 
click [here](/3-send/1-sendOnline.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-1sendOnline-send) when composing online or 
click [here](/3-send/2-sendInbox.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-2sendInbox-listattraddr) if sending from your personal inbox.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-custapppage"></span>
### New! Customizable Profile allows members to set values to attributes and join list and sub-groups

The [Profile](/2-members/5-membersProfile.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-5membersprofile) can be set up by the Account Administrator to suit what works for their account's needs.  Which attributes, lists and sub-groups are available on the Profile is determined by how the **Member Profile Page** 
on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Site Customizations** page is set up by the Account Administrator. 

Then when members visit their Profile, they can set values to the attributes or join the lists and sub-groups that appear on their Profile.  Since members 
can now set and join, the Profile replaces customized application pages.  Contact us if you would like help setting this up!

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-shareemails"></span>
### Shared email addresses between GroupVine20 users is no longer allowed

Although members can have multiple addresses, any given address is required to be uniquely assigned to only one user
in the GroupVine20 system, so addresses can no longer be shared.

If an address was being shared between two members, it was likely assigned to one of them.

If a member had both a primary and alternate email address, and one of those email addresses was shared, then
most likely, the email addresses were assigned to separate users.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-dispname"></span>
### How to set your Display Name

Your Display name, which appears in the "From" portion of a sent email,
is your First Name and Last Name in your Profile.  A different Display name can be set for each
GroupVine20 account where you are a sender.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-listname"></span>
### List name change for list names without a letter

List names now require at least one letter (pure numbers are reserved
by the system for identifying lists and groups in a numeric-only way).
So, for example, if you had a list previously named "2021", it has
been changed to "2021list).

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-unusedalts"></span>
### Unused alternate email address were not migrated

If a member's profile had "Always copy alternate address?" set to "No" in our old system, then this email address was not migrated into the GroupVineV20
system, which does not have this setting.  

If you would like to save these email addresses in your GroupVine20 account, one option is to 
create a Custom Attribute on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22">**Member Attributes** page named, 
for example, "Unused Alt Email" and store the address there.    

Contact us if you have any questions or would like help setting this up.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-welcomeemails"></span>
### Option to send Welcome emails, which is currently turned on

On our old system when a new member was added, there was an option to send them a "how-to" email with 
information on how to send email to the group, if the group allowed general group members to send.

In GroupVine20, at a minimum welcome emails will include a link to the member's Profile and to the account's Email Feed, and will include
how to send to the group, if the group allows for that.  If it makes sense for your account, an advantage to sending welcome emails is to 
give members a link to access their Profile, where they can set attribute values and join lists and sub-groups.

Currently migrated account have welcome emails sent and you can skip sending welcome emails to new members by 
setting *Always send welcome emails?* on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22">**Account Settings** page.  

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-sendemail"></span>
## Sending Email

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-sendemail-confemail"></span>
### New! Confirmation Required for Emails from Personal Inbox to Unmoderated Groups

Confirm emails sent from your personal inbox to unmoderated groups
Spammers are sometimes able to highjack personal email addresses, and
then send spam to all of that person's contacts, including the
GroupVine email communities they are able to send to.  To help avoid
this risk, when emails are sent from your personal inbox to any
account or sub-group address that isn't already being moderated, the
GroupVine20 system will immediately respond with a Confirmation
request email to confirm that the email is legitimate.  Also, all
bounce message reports are sent to the sender.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-sendemail-templates"></span>
### New! Templates make it faster and easier to compose periodic emails

A template is a special saved email that can be used as a starting point for new emails that you send often, e.g. weekly newsletters, daily posts, announcements, and reports.  Once your template's look is set up, using them will save you the time of recreating your email's look and basic content each time you send your periodic email.

Click [here](/3-send/5-resend.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-6templates) for more information on creating and using templates.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-sendemail-ewsattrsinbox"></span>
### New! Email Widgets and attributes can be sent from a personal inbox

Email Widgets are a simple and powerful tool that make it easy to ask questions, collect information, start conversations and gather feedback right in an email. From their inbox, recipients can add responses and comments and see up-to-date images that summarize Email Widget responses.  For a further introduction and more information on Email Widgets, click [here](/5-widgets/1-ewIntro.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-5widgets-1ewintro)

Custom Attributes are used to save member information that is specific to your account needs and to customize your emails.  Attributes can also be used
to target recipients who have an attribute set to a specific values.  For more information on Attributes, click [here](/2-members/4-membersAttributes.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-4membersattributes).

To include Email Widgetes to emails created from an inbox, click [here](/3-send/2-sendInbox.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-2sendInbox-useattrs) and to include attribute values click [here](/3-send/2-sendInbox.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-3send-2sendInbox-useattrs).

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-sendemail-listaddr"></span>
### List email addresses have changed - update your contacts!

This only needs your attention if you email to a list where its email address is saved in your personal email account's contacts.  Updating the
list's email address in your contacts is all that's needed to continue to easily use a saved address in your contacts.

The change to the email address was done to make the list address simpler, for example, the new list address will be

```
ListAddress~~AccountName@groupvine.com
```

Instead of

```
list=ListAddress++AccountName@groupvine.com
```
