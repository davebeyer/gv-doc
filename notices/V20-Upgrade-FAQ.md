## Membership

### Shared email addresses between GroupVine20 users is no longer allowed

Although members can have multiple addresses, any given address is required to be uniquely assigned to only one user
in the GroupVine20 system, so addresses can no longer be shared.

If an address was being shared between two members, it was likely assigned to one of them.

If a member had both a primary and alternate email address, and one of those email addresses was shared, then
most likely, the email addresses were assigned to separate users.

### How to set your Display Name

Display names, which appears in the "From" portion of a sent email,
is your First Name and Last Name in your Profile.  Display names can be set for each
GroupVine20 account where you are a sender.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-unusedalts"></span>
### Unused alternate email address were not migrated

For users who had "Do not send to my alternate email address" set to
"No" in their profile, then this email address was not migrated into the GroupVineV20
system, which does not have this setting.  

If you would like to save these email addresses in your GroupVine20 account, one option
would be to create a Custom Attribute on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Member Attributes** page named, for example, "Unused Alt Email" and store the address there.   

Contact us if you have any questions or would like help setting this up.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-listname"></span>
### List names change for list names without a letter

List names now require at least one letter (pure numbers are reserved
by the system for identifying lists and groups in a numeric-only way).
So, for example, if you had a list previously named "2021", it has
been changed to "2021list).

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-mem-custapppage"></span>
### Customized member Profile replaces the customized application page 
Help set up Profile - what attributes are available for members to set
and what lists and sub-groups are available for members to join from
their Profile.

## Sending Email

### Confirmation Required for Emails from Personal Inbox to Unmoderated Groups 

Confirm emails sent from your personal inbox to unmoderated groups
Spammers are sometimes able to highjack personal email addresses, and
then send spam to all of that person's contacts, including the
GroupVine email communities they are able to send to.  To help avoid
this risk, when emails are sent from your personal inbox to any
account or sub-group address that isn't already being moderated, the
GroupVine20 system will immediately respond with a Confirmation
request email to confirm that the email is legitimate.  Also, all
bounce message reports are sent to the sender.

<span id="v20-upgrade-FAQ-basics-sendemail-listaddr"></span>
### Email address to send to a list has changed

Attention only needed if you send to specific lists from your personal inbox

list email address have become simpler.  For example, the new list
address will be

'ListAddress++AccountName@groupvine.com'

Instead of

'list=ListAddress~~AccountName@groupvine.com'
