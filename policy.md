### Site's use of Personal Contact Information:

  On users’ "Profile" pages, available via the WG’s membership
  management page, via a link on most other pages, and by uploading
  membership import files, users and/or WG administrators are able to
  provide, view, update, and/or confirm, user contact information
  (such as email and physical address, phone numbers, and profile
  photo) so that they may be made available for private use within the
  Applicable WG Community(s), and any other WGs users choose (and are
  approved) to join or who have been provided with users’ email
  address and have added these user(s) as member(s).  The collection
  of this information by WGs is intended solely for facilitating
  private, community purposes, such as online directories and group
  email lists.  GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> will not sell this information
  to anyone else without User consent, and will not use it for
  unsolicited telemarketing or email (spam) - we dislike these as much
  as you do.

<span id="othersinfo"></span>
### Use of Others' Personal Contact Information:

  You agree to use any personal contact information of other members
  of that WG Community solely for the intended purposes of
  facilitating private communication and collaboration among those
  within that WG Community. You also agree that you will not provide
  such information to anyone outside of the associated WG Community,
  nor use it for unsolicited marketing purposes or any other purposes
  not directly related to the purposes of the Applicable Work Group.

  GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> is not responsible for the use of your
  contact information by other Users and makes no warranty regarding
  the use of your personal contact information by WG(s) in which you
  become a member, nor the degree of compliance to those policies by
  the members of those WG(s).

  choose such material carefully. In addition, you represent and
  warrant that any information you post on this Site is original, or
  that you have the right to copy and distribute that content. The
  Affiliates reserve the right, with or without notice at any time,
  for any reason or no reason, to edit or delete any content, deny
  content editing rights, or eliminate User privileges if, in any of
  their sole judgments, such content is offensive, illegal, or in any
  way inappropriate for the associated WG Community. The information
  on this website might include opinions or views which, unless
  expressly stated otherwise, are not necessarily those of the
  Affiliates, or any associated organization or any person in relation
  to whom they would have any liability or responsibility.

### Right to Remove Users, Groupsite Members, or Groupsites:

  The GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> Site is designed to enhance and develop
  member communities. GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> reserves the right, with
  or without notice at any time, for any reason or no reason, to
  delete any User's account, or delete an entire Groupsite from the
  Site, if in its sole judgments, such User, Groupsite, or Groupsite
  Members are in any way inappropriate for this Site. For example, any Work Group
  or User that discriminates, discourages or limits participation in
  an inappropriate manner, or that GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> believes to be
  using the GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> Site
  to distribute unsolicited or unwanted bulk email, or that
  GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> believes to be attempting to circumvent the
  intended membership limitations for their account, may be removed
  from the Site at the sole discretion of GroupVine<sup>TM</sup>.
  Also, the Affiliates reserve a similar right to revoke the
  membership of any Groupsite Member. 

  In addition, if in GroupVine's<sup>TM</sup> sole judgement it finds
  reason to believe that a User's email has been compromised such that
  a third party may be able to send emails to other members of that User's
  Work Group Communities as if being sent by this User,
  GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> may fully or partially disable this User's
  account, at least until GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> determines that the
  problem has been resolved.

<span id="sitesecurity"></span>
### Site Security:

  GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> makes numerous precautions to protect User
  and Groupsite information and communication. Internet connections to
  the Site are protected by encrypted links and verifiable
  authentication certificates.  Strong cryptographic hashes are used
  for user password authentication.  No user passwords are directly
  stored by GroupVine.  User Profile and WG information within the
  Site is protected by password-protected access controls designed to
  grant access to its contents to only appropriately authorized Users.
  WG email contents can be accessed only
  by password-authenticated Users or by using an individually ticketed
  link to the Groupsite (and the Groupsite's online Email or Email Feed)
  included in emails sent to Groupsite members.  For
  payment processing, GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> partners with established
  payment gateway service companies, and thus, no credit card numbers
  or other personal payment identifiers are stored on the
  GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> site.

<span id="subscriptions"></span>
### Payments for Subscription Accounts:

  GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> Service is supported generally by
  subscription payments and/or, for certain markets, by advertisements
  that may appear with the content of Site web pages and group emails.

  Subscription payments must be made in U.S. dollars.  If you provide
  GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> with a credit card for payment, you hereby
  authorize GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> to charge that credit card for such
  amounts on a regular basis, according to the payment period you have
  selected, continuing until such time as your GroupVine<sup>TM</sup>
  account is terminated, whether or not you or other Groupsite Members
  are actively using the associated Groupsite account.  You are also
  responsible for reviewing the applicable Fee Schedules from time to
  time to remain aware of the fees and any applicable discounts, which
  are subject to change at any time at GroupVine’s<sup>TM</sup> sole
  discretion.  If you do not agree to such changes, you should contact
  GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> to terminate your account (refer to the
  “Termination” section below).

  If at or near the end of your subscription period,
  GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> is for any reason unable to effect automatic
  payment by credit card, or if you have selected a non-recurring
  payment option, GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> will attempt to notify you by
  email or otherwise and, upon expiration of your paid subscription
  period, your GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> account and Groupsite may be
  fully or partially disabled until payment is received.


  GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> may be required to collect and pay sales tax
  for subscription Groupsite customers located in certain state and
  local jurisdictions, including those where software delivered as a
  service is taxable and where GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> maintains a
  physical presence.  GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> determines each
  Groupsite’s local taxing jurisdiction based on the address provided 
  in each Groupsite’s Account Settings.

<span id="ad-supported"></span>
### Ad-supported Service

  For GroupSite Accounts that are supported by advertisements, you
  agree that that image-based advertisements may appear with the
  content of Site web pages and group emails.  In such accounts, you
  also agree that you will not include additional paid-for
  advertisements in the content of the group emails beyond those that
  GroupVine has incorporated.

<span id="cookies"></span>
### Use of "cookies":

  As part of the security system for the restricted,
  password-protected areas, a cookie will be set on the User's system
  to credential that User. This credential cookie is used to allow the
  User access to those restricted areas that he or she is entitled to
  view and/or edit, while providing the User the convenience of not
  having to enter a username and password every time the User changes
  to a new page.


<span id="serviceproviders"></span>
### Usage of Service Providers:

  GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> uses Service Providers to perform functions
  and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting

  necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and

  parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data.

### Dispute Resolution:

  You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users
  and Work Groups. GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> reserves the right, although
  it has no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other
  Users and Work Groups and to take any action that it deems
  appropriate in its sole discretion, consistent with these Terms,
  including deletion of any User's account or revocation of the
  membership of any Groupsite Member.

  time in which you are a User and/or you help to manage a Groupsite
  as a Groupsite Administrator.

  Groupsite Administrators may terminate their GroupVine<sup>TM</sup>
  account and close their Groupsite at any time by contacting
  GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> customer support, 
  <a href="mailto:support@groupvine.com">support@groupvine.com</a>.
  There are no refunds for any fees paid.

  GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> account or for any credit card or other
  charges or fees incurred as a result of that failure.

  any Groupsite data, including membership information and email
  archives, and including information about the Groupsite itself,

  this Agreement at any time with or without cause.  If terminated
  without cause, GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> will refund a pro rata portion
  of your subscription payment, if applicable.  GroupVine<sup>TM</sup>
  will not refund you in such manner if there is cause due to
  violation of Terms in this Agreement.  
  In particular, if GroupVine<sup>TM</sup>, in its sole judgement,
  suspects a Groupsite of distributing unsolicited or unwanted bulk
  email to its membership, it may terminate the associated account for
  cause, or, at GroupVine's sole discretion, may disable the account
  from sending further emails until that membership has confirmed
  their interest in receiving the Groupsite's emails using a
  GroupVine-specified explicit opt-in procedure.
  In addition, if a Groupsite
  remains inactive for over one year, GroupVine<sup>TM</sup> may deem
  it to be “inactive” and may terminate the account for that Groupsite
  and delete that Groupsite’s data.
