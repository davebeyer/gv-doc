# Quick Start

## Adding email addresses

Once your account is created, you can send yourself an email by sending one created from your online account or by sending one from your personal email account.

If you would like to email others, there are a few ways to do this.  If you have a handful addresses, you can add them one at a time.  Or, if you have a spreadsheet of addresses, you can upload the file.  Or, you can copy and paste addresses as another upload option.

## Send a email

When ready, send an email either from your online account or from your personal email account.

Easy peasy.  And you can check your Email Feed for your new email.
