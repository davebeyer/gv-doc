# Social Email Options

## Commenting on emails

TBD

## Who can send new emails

<div class="trivy only">

  With the Trivy service, only the account administrator is permitted to send 
  new emails (or replies) to the group.

</div>

<div class="gv">

All group Admins and Editors are permitted to send new emails (or
replies) to a group.  Additionally, if the **"Allow group members to
send"** is enabled for that group, then any member can send.

</div>

<div class="adv">

Note that in the case of sub-groups, Admins and Editors of parent (or
grandparent...) groups are also permitted to send to the group.  This
may at times cause some confusion since these members don't
necessarilly receive the group emails, unless they are also explicit members
of the group.
     
</div>

<div class="support">

Lastly, regardless of any Admin or Edtitor role, the account owner is also always a valid
group (or sub-group...) sender.

</div>
