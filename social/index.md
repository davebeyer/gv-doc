## Commenting on emails

TBD

## Who can send new emails

<div class="trivy only">

  With the Trivy service, only the account administrator is permitted to send 
  new emails (or replies) to the group.

</div>

<div class="gv">

Any member designated with the group Admin or Editor role is permitted
to send new emails (or replies) to a group.  Additionally, if the
**"Allow group members to send"** setting is enabled for that group
(disabled by default), then any member can send.

</div>

<div class="adv">

Note that in the case of sub-groups, Admins and Editors of parent (or
grandparent...) group(s) are also permitted to send to the group.  This
may at times cause some confusion since these members don't
necessarilly receive the group emails, unless they are also explicit members
of the group.
     
</div>

<div class="support">

Lastly, regardless of any Admin or Edtitor role, the account owner is also always a valid
group (or sub-group...) sender.

</div>

<div class="gv">

### Email confirmation

To avoid the risk of spammers sending emails to your group from a
compromised email account, all emails sent from your own email account
to the group must be confirmed (by clicking on a "Proceed" button in a
"confirmation email") before being forwarded to the group.  

For emails sent by group Admins, the confirmation email is sent
directly back to the sender for their confirmation.

For emails sent by group Editors, the responsibility for confirming
the email depends on the "Group moderation" setting:

* If "Group moderation" is disabled (the default), then the confirmation 
  is handled the same way, being sent directly back to the sender.  

* If "Group moderation" is enabled, then the confirmation email is
  instead sent to the group Admins who, in addition to guarding
  against spammers, can also moderate the group emails sent by Editors
  to deny distribution of any they feel are not appropriate for their
  group membership.

For group emails generated within your online group account, only
emails sent by Editors when the "Group moderation" setting is enabled
require the above confirmation (Admin approval) step.
