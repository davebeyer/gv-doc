## Commenting on emails

## Who can send new emails

<div class="trivy only">

  With the Trivy service, only the account administrator is permitted to send 
  new emails (or replies) to the group.

</div>

<div class="gv">

Any member designated with the group Admin or Editor role is permitted
to send new emails (or replies) to a group.  Additionally, if the
**"Allow group members to send"** setting is enabled for that group
(disabled by default), then any member can send.

</div>

<div class="adv">

Note that in the case of sub-groups, Admins and Editors of parent (or
grandparent...) group(s) are also permitted to send to the group.  This
may at times cause some confusion since these members don't
necessarilly receive the group emails, unless they are also explicit members
of the group.
     
</div>

<div class="support">

Lastly, regardless of any Admin or Edtitor role, the account owner is also always a valid
group (or sub-group...) sender.

</div>

<div class="gv">

### Email confirmation

To avoid the risk of spammers sending emails to your group from a
compromised email account, all emails sent from your own email account
to the group are confirmed (by clicking on a "Proceed" button in a
"confirmation email") before being sent to the group.  If the email
was sent by a group Admin, then the confirmation email is sent
directly back to the sender for their confirmation.  If the email was
sent by a group Editor, then the responsibility for confirming the
email depends on the "Group moderation" setting.  If
disabled (the default), then the confirmation is handled the same way,
being sent directly back to the sender.  If enabled, then the
confirmation email is instead sent to all group Admins who, in
addition to guarding against spammers, can also moderate the group
emails sent by Editors to deny distribution of any they feel
are not appropriate for their group membership.

For group emails generated within your online group account, only
emails sent by Editors and with the "Group moderation" setting enabled
involve the above confirmation step.
